# Overview

## How synchronization works

Coiote DM provides zero-touch provisioning for devices synchronized with the Azure IoT Hub. This means any devices imported using a CSV file are automatically created within Coiote DM and the Azure IoT Hub and from this time on are synchronized periodically. Therefore, after any successful synchronization, you can be sure that any devices that have been imported via Coiote DM will be presented in their actual state within the Azure IoT Hub.
