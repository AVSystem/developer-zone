# Overview

## How synchronization works

{{ coiote_short_name }} provides zero-touch provisioning for devices synchronized with Azure IoT Hub. This means any devices imported using a CSV file are automatically created within {{ coiote_short_name }} and Azure IoT Hub and from this time on are synchronized periodically. Therefore, after any successful synchronization, you can be sure that any devices that have been imported via {{ coiote_short_name }} will be presented in their actual state within Azure IoT Hub.
