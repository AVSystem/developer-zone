# Webhooks

The **webhook event handler** delivers HTTP(S) requests to public endpoints. Webhooks contain lifecycle events and/or telemetry data which can be delivered to web applications, IoT platforms, API gateways or hyperscaler lambda functions.

## Prerequisites

* A user with access to the {{ coiote_long_name }} and appropriate permissions
* A LwM2M device

!!! info
    You can create up to 10 *event handlers* in your domain. 

## Create a webhook

To create a new webhook event handler, select: **Integrations** > **Data Integration Center**.

Select the events which trigger the HTTP(S) requests.

!!! Info "Event types"
    **Device events** include:

    - Device created
    - First registration
    - {{ coiote_short_name }} writes a value to a device
    - Device successfully executes a firmware update
    - Device deleted

    **Telemetry events** include data which is generated by the device. Events can originate from objects, object instance, resources or resource instances.

## Configure webhook parameters

Webhook parameters include:

* **URL address**
