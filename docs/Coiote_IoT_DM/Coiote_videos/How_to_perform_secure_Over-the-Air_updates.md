# How to perform secure Over-the-Air (OTA) updates? (nRF 9160)

The LwM2M standard makes Over-the-Air (OTA) updates straightforward, reducing the complexity of implementation and management. What's crucial is that it enhances security through authentication and encryption.

To demonstrate the potential of a single update, we use an IoT device with nRF 9160 DK integrated with Anjay IoT SDKâ€”a setup that enables LwM2M Connectivity.

In the tutorial, we'll guide you through a few steps to handle OTA updates, monitor update statuses, and confirm if the device was successfully updated.

Connect your IoT devices with Anjay IoT SDK - LwM2M Client:

* [Anjay Client repository](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay)
* [Anjay Zephyr Client repository](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-zephyr-client)
