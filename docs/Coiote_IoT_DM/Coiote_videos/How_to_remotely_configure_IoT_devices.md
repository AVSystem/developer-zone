# How to remotely configure IoT devices?

With IoT devices enabled with LwM2M protocol, you can use a set of standardized operations to configure your devices remotely.

To prepare your device with LwM2M connectivity, grab Anjay IoT SDK, Anjay Zephyr Client, or any LwM2M Client.

In our tutorial, we'll be exploring remote configuration options such as Read, Write, Observe, and Execute operations.

Connect your IoT devices with Anjay LwM2M Client:

* [Anjay Client repository](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay)
* [Anjay Zephyr Client repository](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-zephyr-client)
