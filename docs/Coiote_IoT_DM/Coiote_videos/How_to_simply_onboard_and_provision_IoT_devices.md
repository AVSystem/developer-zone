# How to simply onboard and provision IoT devices?

If you've struggled with getting your IoT devices securely connected to the cloud, you're not alone â€“ it's a common challenge for many developers. But here's the good news: we've got a straightforward solution, and using the Coiote IoT Device Management Platform can make it easier.

To get started, grab a board with Anjay IoT SDK, Anjay Zephyr Client, or any LwM2M Client. You can find the list [here](https://iotdevzone.avsystem.com/docs/LwM2M_Client/Getting_started/).

In our tutorial, we'll guide you through registering your device and ensuring it's securely provisioned.
We'll cover authentication, confirmed registration, and show you how to check your device's status.

Connect your IoT devices with Anjay LwM2M Client:
