# What types of IoT data are collected and stored in the Coiote?

The Coiote IoT Device Management Platform enables you to gather diverse data types inside the standardized data model offered by the LwM2M protocol.

Within the platform, you'll discover, for example:

- Device Information
- Connectivity Status
- Firmware and Software Versions
- Configuration Data
- Sensor Data
- Location Data
- Security Information
- Battery Status

It equips you with everything needed to monitor the device's health and collect essential data for IoT applications or external platforms.
