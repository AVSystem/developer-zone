## Features

**Visualizing data with widgets in the new Dashboard view**      

We have introduced a brand new **Dashboard** view for displaying widgets used for data visualization. Widgets are set and configured in the **Data model** tab of the **Device Center**      , along with their corresponding Observations to enable data collection. The Dashboard data is displayed per domain and features the following kinds of charts based on the type of data collected:

  - Line chart
  - Boolean chart
  - Gantt chart
  - Punch card chart

## Architectural Changes

**Renamed `cdm.conf` configuration file to `devman.conf`**    

We have renamed the `cdm.conf` configuration filename to `devman.conf` according to the established naming convention.

**Device ID compatibility translation in REST API v3 endpoints**     

We have completed the bidirectional compatibility translation between the old and new **Device ID** format for all the REST API v3 endpoints. In the new **Device ID** format, the **Endpoint name**       is now hashed for better security. 

## Enhancements

**Improvements in displaying tooltips**      

We have fixed the behavior of the tooltips so that the displayed tooltip of one button doesnâ€™t prevent clicking on the neighboring element. We have also introduced small delays when showing and hiding tooltips upon hovering on an UI element.

**Consistent spacings between text fields**      

We have introduced consistent spacings between text fields in **Operations Center** and **Device inventory**.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixed Azure IoT devices cannot be deleted**    

We have fixed a bug which prevented the user from deleting devices connected to an Azure IoT integration. Now, device deletion is instantaneous.

**Fixed hex key validation when adding a device with PSK mode**     

We have fixed the validation of keys typed in the hexadecimal format so that the warning message shows immediately after unclicking the key input. 

**Domain verification when updating Management device entity in Bootstrap**   
   
We have added domain verification when updating the **Management** device entity inside the **Bootstrap** entity. Now, if the **Management** entity already exists it must be visible from the level of **Bootstrap**       task domain, otherwise the task fails.
