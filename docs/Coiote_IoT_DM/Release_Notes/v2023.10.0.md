# v2023.10.0

Previous version: [v2023.9.0](v2023.9.0.md)

## Enhancements

**Hide change password functionality for SSO users**    

We have removed an unintended functionality. Single sign-on users no longer have access to changing their password through the platform interface.

## Bug Fixes

**Fix Device Inventory pagination issues**     

We have fixed issues with pagination in the **Device Inventory**, which occurred after returning to that view from **Device Center**. Bootstrap devices are now properly filtered and the interface shows accurate information.

**Fix DTLS session resumption**  

We have fixed an issue with DTLS session resumption failing after NAT expiration, even if replication was enabled.

**Fix REST API user permissions**     
 
We have fixed inconsistent user permissions, so that it is no longer possible for certain users to delete other users outside the scope of their domain via REST API.
