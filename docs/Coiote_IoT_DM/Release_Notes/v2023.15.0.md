## Enhancements

### Add FOTA steps preview

We have added a new *Firmware Update Flow Preview* card for basic and multicomponent Firmware Update views. The steps summary depends on the image delivery method and the number of components.

### Display firmware version

We have added information about the current firmware version in the FOTA panel and Device Center.

### Add abort FOTA action

We have added the possibility to abort a firmware update already in progress.

## Bug Fixes

### Fix Azure integration
We have fixed an issue with adding devices via Azure Hub and Azure Central on some cloud installations. The devices are now tagged properly and integrate with Azure as expected.
