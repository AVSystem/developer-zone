## Bug Fixes

**Fix device count bug**    

We have fixed an issue with the *Devices fully operable* card in **Operations Center**. Now, the device count is displayed properly. 

**Limit the summary field in TaskReports**      

We have limited the summary field size to prevent data overflow and glitches in the user interface. Now, the summary must be shorter than 10000 characters.

**Fix empty input in Device Creator**      

We have fixed an issue with the *Search by* input in Device Creator displaying the option to clear the content while empty. Now, the option does not appear in the input with no content.

**Introduce API changes notification mechanism**  

We have introduced a mechanism to notify about changes in API. Thanks to this mechanism, it is easier to detect that an update of the API version is needed.

**Fix issue with LegacyMonitoringData API**    
  
We have fixed an issue with `GET /monitoringData/moreSamples` endpoint returning an error. Now, the request to the endpoint returns data correctly.
