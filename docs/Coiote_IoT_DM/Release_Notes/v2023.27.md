## Enhancements

**Fix Swagger UI basic authorization**   

We have fixed an issue with users being unable to authorize in Swagger UI using basic HTTP authorization.

**Handle identical task spawning**     

We have introduced a mechanism to handle multiple identical tasks spawning when using `TasksFromTemplates` API. Now, instead of creating an identical task, the already existing task is restarted. This mechanism prevents *OutOfMemory* errors.Â 

## Bug Fixes

**Fix dropdown issue in FOTA creator**   

We have fixed an issue with the dropdown list moving when scrolling the page in the FOTA creator view.

**Fix dropdown item duplication in FOTA creator**      

We have fixed dropdown list items being duplicated in the FOTA creator view. The issue occurred when selecting from the dropdown list an item other than the default one.
