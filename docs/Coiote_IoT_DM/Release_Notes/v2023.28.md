## Enhancements

**Remove unused table column in User account**   

We have removed the _Last activity_ column from the Sessions table in the **User account** panel. The information provided in the column was unnecessary.

**Add refresh button in User account**    

We have added a refresh button in the top right corner of the **User account** panel. The button reloads the data displayed in the panel.

**Apply error checking in TTS creators**   
  
We have implemented error checking in TTS LoRa device creators. The errors are checked in both management and bootstrap creator views.Â 

## Bug Fixes

**Fix device batch removal**      

We have fixed an issue with removing devices in batches when using the _Select All_ option in **Device inventory**. Now, it is not possible to delete more than 100 devices at once without proper permissions.
