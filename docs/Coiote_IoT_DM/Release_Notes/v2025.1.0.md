# v2025.1.0

Previous version: [v2024.5.0](./v2024.5.0.md)

## Features

**Automatic retry for FOTA in campaigns**  

A new option allows firmware updates in campaigns to retry automatically when specific errors occur. Retries can be configured with a maximum number of attempts and a list of retryable errors, helping campaigns complete more reliably.

**Domain-level control of XML tag access**

Highly privileged users can now configure which XML tags are allowed within a domain through domain properties. These restrictions apply across XML task editors, providing finer control and security while still allowing raw XML editing

## Enhancements

**Improvements to FOTA approval**   

The FOTA approval property configuration in Domain management has now clearer wording, indicating when manager review is required.

**Multicomponent FOTA eligibility tracking**    

Devices are now flagged as eligible for multicomponent FOTA if they report the required firmware update object `/33629`. This makes it easier to identify which devices can participate in multicomponent update campaigns.

**Custom object instance IDs in bootstrap**

Added optional parameters to configure custom instance IDs for Security and Server objects during bootstrap. This allows better compatibility with devices that reject default instance settings.

**Removed unused field from REST API**

Cleaned up the REST API `GET /users/{username}` endpoint by removing the ambiguous `staff` field from user details. This simplifies the API and avoids confusion over unused fields.
