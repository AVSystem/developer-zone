# v2025.10.0

Previous version: [v2025.9.0](./v2025.9.0.md)

## Enhancements

**Removed support for legacy `<store>` tag in XML tasks**    

The deprecated `<store>` tag has been fully removed from XML task configurations, ensuring cleaner task definitions and consistent tag usage across environments. All tasks using the `<store>` tag have been successfully migrated to the new version.

**Adjusted OpenAPI specification for better compatibility**    

Updated the OpenAPI specification to meet OpenAPI Toolsâ€™ validation standards, ensuring better compatibility with tools like Swagger and client code generators.

**Unified handling of data model changes**    

Simplified the way device data model changes are processed by consolidating logic into a shared event stream. This improves performance and consistency across monitoring, Azure integration, and the Data Integration Center.

**Improved stability for custom dialects**    

Adjusted dialect handling to support newly added fields and prevent validation issues when creating custom object definitions. Changes also include migrating dialects to a more scalable format and enhancing overall editor performance.

**Improved sorting in Device Inventory**

Device Inventory now defaults to sorting devices by *Last seen* time, showing the most recently active ones first. The column layout has also been adjusted to make key information more accessible.
