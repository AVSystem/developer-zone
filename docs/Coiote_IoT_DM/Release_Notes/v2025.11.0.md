# v2025.11.0

Previous version: [v2025.10.0](./v2025.10.0.md)

## Features

**Multicomponent FOTA wizards**

Enabled the possibility to create firmware update configurations and campaigns involving multiple firmware components. This gives the users more flexibility in managing complex update scenarios.

## Enhancements

**Webhook timeout details in user guide**

Updated information in *Create webhook handler* guide, including response timeout settings. This clarifies how long the platform waits for external responses when sending data.

**Enhanced filtering in Device inventory**

Users without admin privileges can now filter devices not only by device groups from the current domain but also by subdomain groups, device type groups, and system groups. This makes it easier to manage and locate devices across different levels of the hierarchy.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixed unresponsive `/devices` API**

Resolved an issue where the `GET /devices` API endpoint could become unresponsive due to inefficient alert handling. The alert processing method was rewritten, significantly improving performance under load.
