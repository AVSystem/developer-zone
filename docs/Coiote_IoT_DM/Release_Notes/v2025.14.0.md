# v2025.14.0

Previous version: [v2025.12.0](./v2025.12.0.md)

## Enhancements

**Faster device handshakes**

Improved the device handshake processing, significantly reducing database load. This enhancement boosts performance in the default setup of the environment.

**Improved resilience against malformed input**

Updated internal components to prevent potential service disruptions caused by malformed input. This enhancement strengthens platform stability.

**Improved multicomponent firmware update management**

Added possibility to cancel a firmware update even if retrying is already in progress. Also, copying multicomponent updates is now disabled for devices that donâ€™t support multicomponent firmware.

**More efficient PSK processing during device connection**

Optimized device connection performance by batching key validation requests. This reduces load on the system and improves responsiveness when connecting multiple devices simultaneously.

## Bug fixes

**Fixed session blocking when observation fails**  

Resolved an issue where a failed observation on object `/25` during gateway sessions could block the execution of other tasks. With improved error handling, the session now continues even if the observation request is rejected by the device.
