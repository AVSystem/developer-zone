- Reusable SOTA configurations
- Full and Single action SOTA campaigns
- Optional SOTA campaign approval flow

All actions are supported via dedicated endpoints in SOTA REST API.

**Gateway EID inventory, groups and operations**

The extended LwM2M gateway support introduces:

- Gateway EID (End IoT Device) inventory with a detailed list of end devices managed by gateways 
- EID groups allowing bulk operations
- EID group-level operations that support LwM2M commands, such as Observe, Write, Execute, and Read

## Enhancements

**Improved handling of LwM2M resource instance in XML tasks**

The LwM2M delete and replace options in XML tasks now support paths down to the resource instance level. This change ensures clearer task interpretation and aligns with the LwM2M specification.

**Firmware download in FOTA configuration preview**

Added the option to download the firmware package directly from the FOTA configuration preview. This improvement makes it easier to verify or reuse firmware files.
