Previous version: [v2025.15.0](./v2025.15.0.md)

## Enhancements

**IP address column in device inventory**

Added a new IP address column to the device inventory table, visible by default. You can now filter devices by IP address using the advanced search. IP addresses are also preserved in the URL for easy sharing of filtered views.

**Improved security for resource URLs**

Static URLs are now generated only for secure, randomized resource IDs, and the option to make old resources static has been disabled.

**Faster FOTA campaign creator loading**

Opening the FOTA campaign creator is now much faster. Configurations are loaded in the background only when needed, so the view opens instantly even for large setups.

**Automatic EID clean-up on domain removal**

EID groups and related tasks are now automatically removed when a domain is deleted. This prevents leftover entries in the EID Groups Center and keeps your workspace tidy.

## Bug fixes

**Fixed incorrect message in REST API endpoint**

Fixed a misleading message on the `DELETE /softwareUpdate/configurations/{id}` API endpoint that incorrectly referred to firmware instead of software. The confirmation now correctly states that a software update configuration was deleted.
