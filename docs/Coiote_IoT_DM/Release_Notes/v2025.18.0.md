# v2025.18.0

Previous version: [v2025.17.0](./v2025.17.0.md)

## Features

**Group-level analytics widget creation**

It is now possible to create analytics widgets on the device group level, not just for individual devices. Widgets created for the group are displayed for all devices belonging to the group in their DC Device analytics view. This makes it easier to ensure consistent monitoring across multiple devices at once.

## Enhancements

**Improved version labels in FOTA views**

FOTA views now use consistent labels: “Expected target version” for the value provided by the user and “Reported target version” for the one returned by the device. These changes apply across configurations, campaigns, and update progress views.

**Extended limit for Device inventory search**

Extended the Device inventory search limit to 150 characters. This allows more flexibility when searching for devices with long endpoint names.
