# v2025.2.0

Previous version: [v2025.1.0](./v2025.1.0.md)

## Features

**Filtering FOTA configurations by type**

FOTA configurations can now be filtered by type — basic or multicomponent. This makes it easier to manage and browse firmware update configurations.

## Enhancements

**Device Center label update**

Removed the “BETA” label from Device Center, which is no longer considered a beta version. Also updated the “Go to previous version” button label to “Advanced settings” to indicate that the Device Center is the default view.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixed crash from invalid domain filter**

Fixed an issue where using a saved filter with a deleted or inaccessible domain in Device inventory caused the GUI to crash. The view now loads with valid filters only.
