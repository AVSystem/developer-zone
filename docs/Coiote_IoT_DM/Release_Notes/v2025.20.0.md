# v2025.20.0

Previous version: [v2025.18.0](./v2025.18.0.md)

## Features

**Custom columns in Device inventory**

Custom columns can be now added to the **Device inventory**, enabling organizations to display additional device data. A new *IP address* column is included by default and supports both search and filter. The custom columns feature can be configured only by platform administrators â€“ users can contact Customer Success to request it.

## Enhancements

**Search columns in Device inventory**

Device inventory can now be searched by columns selected from a column picker. This makes it easier to narrow results to the most relevant data and quickly locate devices based on chosen fields.

**Last execution timestamp in expressions API**

Expressions now include the `lastOperationTime` field for End IoT devices in the LwM2M Gateway. This addition makes it easier to track when a device was last processed, improving reporting capabilities.

## Bug fixes

**Fixes for creating widgets on the group level**

Resolved issues where charts behaved incorrectly due to invalid widget names, and where subgroup widgets failed to override parent ones. Widgets now have proper validation, and subgroup widgets correctly override those from parent groups.

**Fixed FOTA cleanup error**

Fixed an error that occurred during the cleanup phase of failed FOTA tasks, which previously caused misleading error messages. The fix ensures that cleanup runs smoothly without affecting the displayed status of firmware updates.
