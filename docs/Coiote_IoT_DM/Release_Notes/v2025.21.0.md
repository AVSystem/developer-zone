Previous version: [v2025.20.0](./v2025.20.0.md)

## Enhancements

**Clearer error messages for FOTA failures**    

FOTA error reporting now shows clear messages when updates fail due to the device not being reachable or a message timeout. This makes it easier to understand the reason behind a failed update.

**Documentation for group-level widgets**   

Added user documentation for the feature that allows creating widgets directly at the group level. This improves usability by ensuring users can find guidance on managing visualizations for grouped devices.

**Error message for mass device removal**   

Added a snackbar message when mass device removal fails due to outdated or changed filter settings. This ensures users are now clearly informed about removal errors.

**Improved FOTA file upload**   

Rewritten the FOTA file upload mechanism to use multi-part uploads, enabling better handling of large files. This improves reliability when uploading firmware images and aligns it with the SOTA file upload flow.
