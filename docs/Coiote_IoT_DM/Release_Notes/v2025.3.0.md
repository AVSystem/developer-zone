# v2025.3.0

Previous version: [v2024.5.0](./v2024.5.0.md)

## Features

**LwM2M Gateway support enabled**

Enabled support for the LwM2M Gateway, allowing communication with End IoT devices that canâ€™t connect directly to the server. The gateway handles routing and data exchange on behalf of these devices, simplifying integration and expanding connectivity options.

**Retry action added to FOTA campaigns**

You can now retry failed updates in a FOTA campaign from the **FOTA campaigns** and **FOTA campaign details** view using a new action button. You can choose to retry all errors or select specific ones to target, streamlining error recovery in campaigns.

**Optional target firmware version in FOTA configuration**

You can now optionally include target firmware version information when creating a FOTA configuration. This makes it easier to track and manage firmware updates before the update target version is reported by the device.

**Support for devices with different firmware versions in FOTA campaigns**

Introduced possibility to schedule FOTA campaigns for devices that have different firmware versions. During the firmware setup you can select a Manufacturer/model device group and multiple firmware versions separately to target a broader range of devices with the same update.

## Enhancements

**Improved documentation for XML task tags**

Enhanced the user documentation for XML tasks by adding clear tag descriptions and practical examples. This update helps users understand and apply XML tags more effectively when configuring tasks.

**Status tracking for failed updates in FOTA campaigns**

FOTA campaigns now indicate when devices have failed their updates, and the status changes automatically once all failures are retried. Additionally, the SOTA status *Retrying* applies when the retry is activated manually. 

**Firmware download in the resource picker**

Added the ability to download firmware files directly when selecting them in the FOTA configuration creator. Users with appropriate permissions can now quickly access firmware files with a dedicated download button.

## Bug Fixes

**Consistent validation of internal addresses in DIC**

Fixed inconsistent handling of internal addresses between Kafka and Webhook handlers in **Device Integration Center**. Both now correctly respect the same validation rule when internal addresses are restricted.

**Fixed issue with deleting domains**

Resolved an issue that caused an error when deleting an empty domain in the EU Cloud. Deleting empty domains now completes smoothly without showing an error.
