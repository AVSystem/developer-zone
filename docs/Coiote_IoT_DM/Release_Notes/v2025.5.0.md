# v2025.5.0

Previous version: [v2025.4.0](./v2025.4.0.md)

## Features

**Reference device selection in FOTA configuration**    

Added a step to select a reference device for multi-component FOTA configuration. Users can filter compatible devices, and the available components are displayed upon selection.

**New FOTA campaign sidebar details**

The FOTA campaign sidebar now displays additional details, including campaign type, target version, and the version before the update. Alerts highlight version mismatches, and a new navigation button provides quick access to detailed information.

**FOTA approval preview with components**

The FOTA approval window for multi-component FOTA now includes a detailed preview of multi-component configurations. This allows users to review all components before approving a campaign, ensuring greater control over the update process.

## Enhancements

**Improved error logging for Kafka messages**    

Increased the maximum message size limit for error logs from Kafka to provide complete error details. If an error message exceeds 200 characters, a "Show more" button is now available to display the full message.

**Configurable automatic refresh in UpdateRequest**    

Added a new dialect flag allowing users to enable or disable automatic READ and DISCOVER operations when a device sends an UpdateRequest with new objects. By default, this behavior remains enabled, but it can now be turned off to reduce unnecessary load on resource-constrained devices.

**Disabled irrelevant task parameters for *Discard report* option**    

When the *Discard report* option is enabled in task configuration, the fields that are not applicable are now disabled and set to predefined values. This improves clarity by ensuring only relevant settings are available.

**Improved task domain handling**    

Enhanced task creation rules to ensure tasks created from templates inherit the selected user domain. Group task reports now remain in their original domain when a device moves providing better domain consistency and clearer data visibility.

**Improved error handling for REST API `POST /users`**    

The API now returns a 403 error instead of 400 when a user lacks IAM permissions and a 409 error for duplicate usernames. Custom error messages have been added for password policy violations and invalid emails.

**Improved FOTA session handling**    

Enhanced FOTA execution by ensuring observation resets properly, preventing timeouts during the resetting state machine step. If no notifications are received, the system now falls back to a read request to maintain progress.

**Expanded permissions for *iottenantadmin* role**

The *iottenantadmin* role now includes permissions to modify the device connectivity domain property and export devices to a CSV file, improving administrative capabilities.

**Improved group management rules**

Updated the group assignment process to display only valid groups based on domain hierarchy. This ensures a more structured and consistent approach to managing device groups.


## Bug Fixes

**Bootstrap security mode correction**    

Fixed an issue where the bootstrap security mode was randomly changing from CERT to PSK, causing re-bootstrap failures. The system now ensures that security mode changes are handled correctly, preventing unintended reconfigurations.

**Fixed domain creation conflicts**

Resolved an issue where automatically created user domains could conflict with existing domain groups. Now, when a new user logs in for the first time and their domain needs to be generated based on predefined settings, the system detects potential conflicts and prevents them, providing relevant guidance.
