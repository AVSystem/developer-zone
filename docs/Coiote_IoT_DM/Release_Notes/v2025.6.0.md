# v2025.6.0

Previous version: [v2025.5.0](./v2025.5.0.md)

## Features

**Cancel FOTA task**        

Added the ability to cancel a FOTA update with a new tag. This allows for programmatic cancellation of FOTA updates, aligned with the same logic used in the FOTA UI.

**Observation-only strategy for FOTA**    

Added a new FOTA strategy that uses only observations on individual firmware resources, skipping all Read operations. This is especially useful for devices that support limited observation paths and experience connectivity issues with Reads. 

**Device CSV import view in Angular**    

Introduced a new device import view. The updated version supports both basic and advanced import modes, improved validation, import logs, and better user feedback for large imports.


## Enhancements

**Improved group dispatcher with rule-based validation**    

Group dispatcher now follows enhanced validation rules for group assignments. In the **Groups > Migrations** panel, group suggestions are limited to valid options within the selected domain, helping prevent misconfigurations. 

**Improved domain handling in task creation**    

Domain selection in the task editor now follows updated validation rules to prevent invalid configurations when using task templates. These changes ensure better consistency and control when managing tasks across different domains.

**Improved validation for device and group assignments**    

Illegal domain or group assignments for devices now trigger improved error messages instead of being automatically corrected. This change ensures stricter validation, better transparency, and easier debugging when trying to save invalid data.


## Bug Fixes

**Fixed missing option to delete multiple devices**    

Restored the ability to delete multiple devices at once from the Device Inventory for users with the correct permissions. The option was previously available only to superusers due to a permission misconfiguration.

**Fixed group assignment after expression-based search**    

Resolved an issue where devices filtered using expressions couldnâ€™t be added to a group. The action now works correctly for all search types.

**Fixed removal of outdated group task reports**    

Group task reports are now removed according to the retention policy. This ensures outdated reports don't linger in the system, keeping task results clean and relevant.

**Fixed duplicate entries in Device logs**    

Resolved an issue where retransmitted CoAP requests were logged multiple times, even though only one request was actually sent. Logs now correctly reflect a single entry per request.

**Fixed FOTA timeout at resetting state machine step**    

Resolved an issue where pull FOTA tasks could hang due to missing observation refresh, causing timeouts during the reset phase. The update now forces an observation reset and includes a fallback Read to ensure the process can be completed.

**Fixed missing /3 object in data model**    

Devices now correctly display the Device object (/3) in the data model even when the refresh-data-model task is disabled. The fix ensures data from the initial Read is stored and shown in the UI.

**Fixed incorrect integer values in Data model view**    

Resolved an issue where large integer values were displayed incorrectly in the **Data model**. These values are now represented accurately.
