# v2025.7.0

Previous version: [v2025.6.0](./v2025.6.0.md)

## Features

**Canceling FOTA via API**

Added the ability to cancel an ongoing FOTA update using the API. This feature mirrors the cancellation flow available in the GUI and improves automation support.

## Enhancements

**Improved tracking of data updates in Data model**

Introduced a new metric to help track device-reported values, offering clearer insight into when updates are based on recent or historical data. This makes it easier to monitor device behavior and ensure accurate data visibility.

**Domain validation for task creation and reports**

Updated task creation rules to prevent assigning tasks to domains lower than the device or group's domain, ensuring stricter and more predictable domain visibility. The domain picker dynamically adjusts based on the selected target, and REST API enforces these constraints. Task reports also retain their original domain when a device is moved across domains.

**Automatic removal of domain-inaccessible tasks**

The system now automatically removes tasks that no longer have access to the device due to domain changes. This enhancement helps maintain data relevance by leveraging the existing task retention mechanism.

**Improved visibility in FOTA campaign statistics**

The **Overview** tab in FOTA campaign view now includes devices with the status *Retrying*. These devices are displayed in a separate card to make tracking update progress easier.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixed validation for FOTA API parameters**

Fixed a minor issue where invalid values in FOTA configurations and campaigns were not always properly validated. The API now correctly returns errors when unsupported values are provided.
