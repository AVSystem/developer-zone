# v2025.8.0

Previous version: [v2025.7.0](./v2025.7.0.md)

## Enhancements

**Improved handling of received data in the Data model**    

Enhanced data model behavior to ensure values sent by devices are correctly reflected, even if delayed. The system now prioritizes the time a value was sent over the time it was received, improving data accuracy for battery-powered and intermittently connected devices.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixes in FOTA campaign and configuration creators**    

- Fixed a missing *Back* button in the Add FOTA configuration - Multi-component creator. 
- Resolved an issue where users couldnâ€™t proceed to the second step in the FOTA campaign creator after toggling the auto-retry option. 
- Fixed a problem where all entered data was lost upon page refresh in FOTA creators. 

**Correct retry counts and device visibility in FOTA campaign details**    

Fixed an issue where retrying devices were not counted correctly in the campaign statistics. Also resolved a problem where devices disappeared from the *Updates started* tab after the associated FOTA configuration was deleted.
