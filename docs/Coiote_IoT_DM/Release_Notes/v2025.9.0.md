# v2025.9.0

Previous version: [v2025.7.0](./v2025.7.0.md)

## Features

**Added ability to cancel FOTA using the API**

It is now possible to cancel an ongoing firmware update via the API by specifying its ID. This allows for better control over update processes and helps prevent unwanted executions.

## Enhancements

**Improved CSV import user interface**

Updated the interface for importing devices from CSV accessible under **Device inventory > Add device > Import devices from CSV**. Revised the documentation to reflect the new user interface.

## Bug Fixes

**Fixed UI glitch in bootstrap server selection**

Resolved an issue where the bootstrap server picker in the device creator was partially hidden when selecting the default server option. The picker is now displayed correctly regardless of panel height.

**Fixed validation issue in manually added dialects**

Resolved a problem where manually added dialects could not be saved due to a validation error. The fix restores the ability to define new dialects without relying on default templates.

**Fixed issue with adding users to domains**

Fixed an issue with long loading times and occasional failures when assigning users to a domain. Now the functionality works reliably even in big scale environments.
