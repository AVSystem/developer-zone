## Features

!!! Note
    Features marked with an "*" are only included in the premium version of {{ coiote_short_name }}.

### Device inventory

The Device inventory provides a comprehensive overview of all registered LwM2M devices. After selecting one of your devices, you enter the **Device center** which allows you to monitor and manage single devices.

In the **Device center**, you can:

* Adjust device configurations
* Set observations
* Schedule firmware updates
* Visualize device data
* Access detailed device logs

The key features of **Device center** include:

* **Device analytics**: The Device analytics board provides tools for monitoring and visualizing device data through customizable widgets. It supports real-time and historical data analysis with options to adjust time ranges, zoom into charts, and enable live data display with five-second refresh intervals. Widgets can be reordered, or removed to suit specific monitoring needs, and device monitoring can be toggled to control data collection and storage.

* **Device logs**: The Device logs tab offers detailed visibility into log data for troubleshooting and performance monitoring. It includes a histogram for log volume analysis, a searchable and filterable log entries list, and tools for defining relative or absolute time ranges for log retrieval. Real-time monitoring is supported with live log updates, and filters allow targeted viewing for protocols such as CoAP and LwM2M.

### Device groups*

Devices can be added to **Groups** allowing for easy management of your device fleet. Instead of managing devices one by one, configurations can be updated for a group of devices with a single click.

### Integrations

{{ coiote_short_name }} supports integrations with popular cloud platforms such as **Azure IoT Hub**, **AWS IoT Core** or **nRF Cloud**. The **Device Integration Center** enables the configuration of **Webhook** and **Kafka** event handlers, supporting real-time event streaming and tailored device interactions.

### Device test repository*

You can test performance of your device firmware by mimicking real-world scenarios. Device tests allow you to validate new application firmware, to test the implementation of the LwM2M standard, and to run regression tests to ensure new firmware doesnâ€™t break existing functionality.

### Fleet FOTA

This feature allows efficient firmware updates across your entire device fleet. You can create **FOTA configurations** to define update parameters, such as target firmware versions and use it later for an update on a single device or to create a **FOTA campaign**. FOTA campaigns enable you to plan, schedule, and monitor large-scale updates for specific groups of devices. 

### Administration

The administration section provides tools for configuring platform settings, including **Billing**, **User management**, and **Domain management**.
