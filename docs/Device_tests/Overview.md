# Overview

Device tests are a comprehensive and convenient solution for the customization and performance of LwM2M protocol tests on LwM2M devices.
Offered as part of the **Coiote IoT Device Management** platform, it enables you develop tests from scratch to tailor them to your devices, or use the ready-made test scenarios (including those described in the [**OMA Enabler Test Specification**](https://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/ETS/OMA-ETS-LightweightM2M-V1_1-20190912-D.pdf) for Lightweight M2M by **OMA SpecWorks** and the scenarios created by **AVSystem**).

The following guide walks you through the basic functionalities of the device tests solution. You will learn how to configure, run and manage your tests and get to know in detail each possible action that can be defined within a test.
