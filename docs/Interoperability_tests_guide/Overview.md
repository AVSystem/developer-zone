# Overview

Interoperability tests are a comprehensive and convenient solution for the customization and performance of LwM2M protocol tests on LwM2M devices.
Offered as part of the Coiote IoT Device Management platform, it enables you develop test cases from scratch to tailor them to your devices, or use the ready-made test cases (including scenarios described in **OMA Enabler Test Specification** for Lightweight M2M by **OMA SpecWorks** and scenarios created by **AVSystem**).

The following guide will walk you through the basic functionalities of the interoperability tests solution. You will learn how to configure, run and manage your test cases and get to know in detail each possible action that can be defined within a test case.
