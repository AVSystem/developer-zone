# Runtime Certificate and Private Key Configuration

## Introduction
Anjay library supports secure connection between device and server. Encryption can be achieved with the use of Pre-Shared Key as it was described in [nRF9160](nRF9160.md) and [Thingy:91](Thingy91.md) pages or with certificate-based cryptography.

In **Certificate Mode** an asymmetrical algorithm is used to authenticate the connection endpoints and initialize payload encryption. Appropriate certificates need to be generated for both the LwM2M Client and the LwM2M Server. Public certificates of both parties are mutually available, and each party also has access to its corresponding private key.

You can read more about secure communication on [Anjay's documentation](https://avsystem.github.io/Anjay-doc/BasicClient/BC-Security.html) page.

## Prerequisites
* The nRF9160 DK board with a USB cable.
* Cloned [Anjay-zephyr-client](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-zephyr-client#getting-started) repository

!!! Note
    Go through the README's `Getting Started` part.

* Installed [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/source/)
* Installed **minicom** (for Linux), **RealTerm**, **PuTTy** (for Windows), or another serial communication program.
* An active [Coiote IoT DM](https://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud/) user account.

!!! Note

    The runtime certificate and private key configuration do not work with other boards.

## Build and flash the device
0. Connect the nRF9160 DK board to a USB port of your machine.
0. Enter the command line interface on your machine and change the directory to the one where you set up the Zephyr project (usually, it's `~/zephyrproject`).
0. Go to your local **Anjay-zephyr-client/demo** directory
0. Set manifest file to `west-nrf.yml`, and do `west update`:

    ```
    west config manifest.path Anjay-zephyr-client/demo
    west config manifest.file west-nrf.yml
    west update
    ```

0. Build a project with a runtime certificate and private key.

    This feature works with nRF9160 DK starting from revision v0.14.0. For this board use configuration that utilizes an external flash chip and software-based cryptography:

    ```
    west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns@0.14.0 -p -- -DCONF_FILE=prj_extflash.conf -DOVERLAY_CONFIG="overlay_nrf_mbedtls.conf"
    ```

0. Flash the board with `west flash` command.

## Generate certificate
The certificate and private key based on the SECP256R1 curve can be provided through the shell interface in `.pem` format. To generate To generate a self-signed certificate and key pair open a terminal in the **Anjay-zephyr-client/demo** directory and use the following commands.

```
openssl ecparam -name secp256r1 -out ecparam.der
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -newkey ec:ecparam.der -keyout demo-cert.key -out cert.pem -days 3650
openssl ec -in demo-cert.key -outform pem -out key.pem
```

!!! Important

    To use the certificate and private key with Coiote IoT DM you must specify a common name that is the same as the client endpoint name.

You will see two files `cert.pem` and `key.pem` created in the `Anjay-zephyr-client/demo` directory.

## Configure the Client
0. Provide the generated certificate and private key through the shell in the serial communication program.

    !!! Note

        Before setting configurations in Anjay you need to stop running Anjay by `anjay stop` command.

    Run these commands and paste the content of the files generated in the previous step.

    ```
    anjay config set public_cert
    anjay config set private_key
    ```

0. Save changes, start Anjay using `anjay start` command and go to the next step to add a device to Coiote.

## Add device to Coiote IoT DM

0. Upon logging in to Coiote IoT DM for the first time, you will see the **Add your LwM2M device** panel.

    !!! note
        If you had previously added a device, in **Device inventory**, click the **Add device** button.

0. Select the **Connect your LwM2M device directly via the Management server** tile.
   ![Add via Mgmt](images/ex1.3.png "Add via Mgmt")
0. In the **Device credentials** step:
     - In the **Endpoint name** enter your LwM2M device endpoint name, e.g. `anjay-zephyr-demo`.
     - In the **Security mode** section, select **Certificate** mode.
        ![Device credentials step](images/add_mgmt_cert.png "Device credentials step")
     - Click **Upload a new certificate** and **Browse**.
     - In the pop-up, go to the directory where your certificate has been generated, select the `cert.pem` file and click **Open**.
     - Click **Add device**.

!!! Note
    The **Endpoint name** which you enter to the Coiote IoT DM should be the same as it is in the Client configuration.

0. Click **Next**, **Go to Summary** to skip the third step, and **Finish** to see your Device Center.
