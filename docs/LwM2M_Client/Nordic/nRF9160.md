# nRF9160

Integrate your Nordic nRF9160 board.

## Prerequisites

- The nRF9160 board with a USB cable.
- Installed **minicom** (for Linux) or RealTerm or PuTTy (for Windows) or other serial communication program.
- Installed **nrfjprog** from [Nordic Semiconductor page](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nrf-command-line-tools/download)
- A user with access to the Coiote IoT Device Management platform and appropriate permissions.


## Prepare binaries
### Use an already built binary

To get the latest binary file and flash the board:

0. Go to [Anjay-zephyr-client](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-zephyr-client/releases).
0. Download the `demo_nrf9160dk_merged.hex` file.
0. To program the board, go through the whole process of **flashing nRF** [described here](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/ug_nrf9160_gs.html).
0. Use the nRF Connect Programmer with the downloaded `.hex` file and execute steps from the [Updating the application firmware](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/ug_nrf9160_gs.html#updating-the-application-firmware) section.
0. Reset the board and go to the [Connecting to the LwM2M Server](#connecting-to-the-lwm2m-server).

### Start development using samples
!!! Note
    This step is optional. If you've gone through the [Use an already built binary](#use-an-already-built-binary) step, you can jump to [Connecting to the LwM2M Server](#connecting-to-the-lwm2m-server).


#### Part 1: Getting Zephyr and Python dependencies

To get the Zephyr SDK and dependencies follow the first 4 steps of the instruction provided by [the Zephyr Project](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html) (from the set up the OS to installing the Zephyr SDK).

#### Part 2: Cloning the Anjay zephyr repository

Enter the command line interface on your machine and change the directory to the one where you set up the Zephyr project (usually, it's `~/zephyrproject`), then paste and run the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-zephyr-client
   ```

#### Part 3: Compiling the example

0. Connect the nRF9160 board to a USB port of your machine.
0. Set West manifest path to `Anjay-zephyr-client/demo`, manifest file to `west-nrf.yml`, and do `west update`:

    ```
    west config manifest.path Anjay-zephyr-client/demo
    west config manifest.file west-nrf.yml
    west update
    ```

0. Compile the project for **nRF9160**:

    ```
    cd Anjay-zephyr-client/demo
    west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160ns
    ```

0. Find the `merged.hex` file under the `build/zephyr` directory in the project folder.

0. Use the nRF Connect Programmer to flash the created `.hex` file onto the board. For more information, follow the [updating the application firmware](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/ug_nrf9160_gs.html#updating-the-application-firmware) documentation.

## Connecting to the LwM2M Server

To connect to Coiote IoT Device Management LwM2M Server, please register at [https://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud](https://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud).

To connect the board:

1. Log in to Coiote DM and from the left side menu, select **Device Inventory**.
2. In **Device Inventory**, click **Add device**.
3. Select the **Connect your LwM2M device directly via the Management server** tile.
       ![Add via Mgmt](images/mgmt_tile.png "Add via Mgmt")
    3. In the **Device credentials** step:
         - In the **Device ID** enter your board endpoint name, e.g. `test_device`.
             ![Device credentials step](images/add_mgmt_quick.png "Device credentials step")
         - In the **Security mode** section, select the **PSK (Pre-Shared Key)** mode:
              - In the **Key identity** field, type the same name as in the `Endpoint name` field
              - In the **Key** field, type the shared secret used in the device-server authentication.
    4. Click the **Add device** button and **Confirm** in the confirmation pop-up.
    5. In the **Connect your device** step, follow the [next section](#configuring-the-client) to run the client and connect it to the server.

## Configuring the Client

0. With the board still connected to a serial port interface, open a serial communication program.
0. Use the `anjay` command to list possible options:

    ```
    uart:~$ anjay
    anjay - Anjay commands
    Subcommands:
    start   :Save config and start Anjay
    stop    :Stop Anjay
    config  :Configure Anjay params
    ```

    !!! tip
        To show available subcommands, use the **Tab** key.

0. Check your default credentials by following the instructions in the program:
    ![Anjay configuration](images/anjay_config.png "Anjay configuration"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 1177px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 17px;"}


    !!! note
        If your default credentials are different from device credentials provided in Coiote DM, change them using the `anjay config set <possible_option> <value>` command.
        <br/>
        ![Anjay set configuration](images/anjay_config_set.PNG "Anjay set configuration"){:style="float: left;margin-right: 1177px;margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 17px;"}


0. Use the `anjay start` command to run the Client.
0. Go to Coiote DM to check if your device is connected. Click **Next**, then **Go to Summary**, then **Finish**. You will see your Device Center view:
    ![Registered device](images/registered_device.png "Registered device")

!!! note
    When Anjay has no connection with the server or network for a long time, warning
    `at_monitor: No heap space for incoming notification: <notification>` may appear.
    It does not affect the operation of the application and will no longer appear after reconnection.

!!! note
    **nRF9160** uses the same radio for GPS and LTE connectivity. GPS signal is
    caught between LTE transmissions and in case GPS "cold" fix acquisition takes
    too much time, Anjay turns off LTE transmissions for the time of fix acquisition.
    It can be seen by the following warning: `gps_nrf: GPS was interrupted multiple
    times by the LTE modem when producing a fix`. Anjay is notified by it, enters
    offline mode and reconnects when the first fix is acquired and LTE is enabled back.
