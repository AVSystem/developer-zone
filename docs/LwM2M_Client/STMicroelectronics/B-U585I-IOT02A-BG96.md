# B-U585I-IOT02A/BG96

Integrate your **B-U585I-IOT02A** Discovery kit board along with the default-provided **Quectel BG96** modem.

## Prerequisites

- The **STM32U585I-IOT02A/BG96** board with a Micro-USB cable.
- The serial communication program, such as **minicom** (for Linux) or RealTerm or PuTTY (for Windows) installed.
- A user with access to the Coiote IoT Device Management platform.
- Optional: installed **STM32CubeIDE**.

## Prepare Anjay client application
### Use an already built binary

To get the latest binary file and flash it to the board:

0. Go to [Anjay-freertos-client](https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-freertos-client/releases/).
0. Download the `Anjay-freertos-client-B-U585I-IOT02A-BG96.bin` file.
0. To flash the board, open your **File manager** and drag the downloaded `.bin` file to your **DIS_U585AI** external device.
0. You will see a blinking diode on your board. The diode stops blinking as soon as the flashing is finished.

### Start development using samples

!!! Note
    This step is optional. If you've gone through the [Use an already built binary](#use-an-already-built-binary) step, you can jump to [Connecting to the LwM2M Server](#connecting-to-the-lwm2m-server).

#### Clone the Anjay freeRTOS client repository

Enter the command line interface on your machine and run the following command:

   ```
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/AVSystem/Anjay-freertos-client
   ```

#### Build binary and flash the board

0. Connect the **STM32U585I-IOT02A** board to a USB port of your machine.
0. Go to the **STM32CubeIDE**.
0. Import the project cloned in the previous step to your workspace:
    - From the navigation bar, select **File** and click **Import**.
    - From the **General** list, select **Existing Projects into Workspace** and click **Next**.
    - In **Select root directory**, indicate the catalog containing the cloned Anjay freeRTOS client repository.
    - In the **Projects** field, select **Anjay-freertos-client-B-U585I-IOT02A-BG96** and click **Finish**.
    ![Import project](images/import.png "Import project")
0. In the Project Explorer, navigate to the **Anjay-freertos-client-B-U585I-IOT02A-BG96** project:
    - Choose "Debug" configuration and build the project by right-clicking on the project name and selecting **Build Project**. The build should take less than one minute to complete.
    - After the build is finished, right-click on the project name, select **Run As** and click the **1 STM32 Cortex-M C/C++ Application** option.
    - In the **Launch Configuration Selection**, choose the **Anjay-freertos-client-B-U585I-IOT02A-BG96** option and click **OK**.
0. After the build and run are complete, the board is flashed with compiled binary.


## Connect to the LwM2M Server

To connect to Coiote IoT Device Management LwM2M Server, please register [here](https://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud).

!!! note
     If you use BG96-based configuration, you must upgrade the firmware of the modem to at least the `BG96MAR02A08M1G` revision. Older versions may cause unexpected loss of connection.
     <br />
     To upgrade this firmware please download the folowing .zip files:
     <br />
     - [Pack_BG96MAR02A08M1G_01.012.01.012](./resources/Pack_BG96MAR02A08M1G_01.012.01.012.zip "Pack_BG96MAR02A08M1G_01.012.01.012"),
     <br />
     - [Quectel_LTE_Windows_USB_Driver_V2.0](./resources/Quectel_LTE_Windows_USB_Driver_V2.0.zip "Quectel_LTE_Windows_USB_Driver_V2.10"),
     <br />
     - [QFlash_V4.10](./resources/QFlash_V4.10.zip "QFlash_V4.10").
     <br />
     In Pack_BG96MAR02A08M1G_01.012.01.012 you will find step-by-step instruction. Step 2 and step 4 in this instruction doesn't work. For that reason you will need to download Quectel_LTE_Windows_USB_Driver_V2.0 file, as a required file for step 2, and QFlash_V4.10 file, as a required file for step 4.

To connect the board:

1. Log in to Coiote DM and from the left side menu, select **Device Inventory**.
2. In **Device Inventory**, click **Add device**.
3. Select the **Connect your LwM2M device directly via the Management server** tile.
       ![Add via Mgmt](images/mgmt_tile.png "Add via Mgmt")
    3. In the **Device credentials** step:
         - In the **Device ID** enter your board endpoint name, e.g. `test_device`.
             ![Device credentials step](images/add_mgmt_quick.png "Device credentials step")
         - In the **Security mode** section, select the **PSK (Pre-Shared Key)** mode:
              - In the **Key identity** field, type the same name as in the `Endpoint name` field
              - In the **Key** field, type the shared secret used in the device-server authentication.
    4. Click the **Add device** button and **Confirm** in the confirmation pop-up.
    5. In the **Connect your device** step, follow the next [section](#configure-the-client) to run the client and connect it to the server.

## Configure the Client

1. With the board still connected to a serial port interface, open your serial communication program.
2. Press the reset button located on the board. This should trigger the following prompt:

    ``Press any key in 3 seconds to enter config menu...``

3. Press any key, and in the configuration menu, change the default credentials to your data by following the instructions presented in the program, then save it.

    !!! tip
        LwM2M Server URI, endpoint name and other information you can be found in the **configuration** tab.

    !!! important
        APN (Access Point Name) is the name of a gateway between a GSM, GPRS, 3G and 4G mobile network and another computer network. If you use a built-in Truphone eSIM card, change the APN to **iot.truphone.com**.

    !!! Note
        If you use an external SIM card, you need to verify the APN used by your SIM card provider.

4. Go to Coiote DM to check if your device is connected. Click **Next**, then **Go to Summary**, then **Finish**. You will see your Device Center view:
