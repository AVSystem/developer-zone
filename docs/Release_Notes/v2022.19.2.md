### ‘Impersonated by’ column in task edition history of **Historical analysis**
 We have added the ‘Impersonated by’ column to theTask edition history table that shows the UserID of the actual user (impersonator) who executed the recorded action from the account of the user being impersonated.


## Architectural Changes

### **Device ID** changes to **Endpoint name**
We have changed the **Device ID** label to **Endpoint name** in Device inventory, Device Center and other relevant views. This has been triggered by major changes in how the device endpoint name is now encrypted in the database.

## Bug Fixes

Deleting *Devices registration status action* no longer causes devices to change domains.

Snackbars appearing In the "Connect your device” step of Device creator will now disappear when navigating to the next step.

### Fixed searching for task templates
