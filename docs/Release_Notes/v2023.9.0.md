# v2023.9.0

Previous version: [v2023.7.0](v2023.7.0.md)

## Architectural Changes

### New Firmware update tab

We have added the possibility to conduct  both Basic and Multi-component Firmware Update in the user interface. This functionality is accessible through the **Device Center > Firmware update > Update Firmware**.  We have also added two new cards in the device Firmware update tab. The *Device firmware* card displays the last recorded information about the current firmware version of the device. The *Updates list* card contains a table with a detailed overview of executed and scheduled firmware updates

## Enhancements

### Improve device logs
We have introduced a configuration change, so that information about failed connection attempts is included in the device logs.

## Bug Fixes

### Fix unwarranted tag in XML tasks
We have fixed a bug, which caused the `<ensureObservation>` tag being injected into XML task code when scheduling a task via API.

### Fix error not being logged
We have fixed an error message not being properly logged in case a device could not obtain an EST certificate after being added via Bootstrap. This occurred if the Endpoint name and certificate Common Name verification (`verifyEpAgainstCertCn` Setting Value) was disabled and a certificate of a different device was used.
