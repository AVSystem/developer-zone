========

New features
------------

 * EST-CoAP /est/crts method was implemented that enables to load chains of certificates to a truststore.
 * New **GET/devices** REST API method was added that supports paging and enables bulk key retrieval.

Improvements
------------

 * Numerous improvements were introduced in the task report retrieval REST API:

   * The *LastUpdateTime* parameter is now required and all *tasksReports* returned have the *lastUpdateTime* after a given one (search is performed starting from the provided *lastUpdateTime*).
   * Providing only the *lastUpdateTime* parameter returns unlimited *TaskReports* (without any *to* date).
   * When *directTasksOnly* is set to ``true``, the reports returned don't include group tasks.
   * When the *directTasksOnly* is set to ``false``, the reports returned contain group tasks as well.
   * The *directTasksOnly* parameter is set to ``false`` on default.
   * *TaskReports* are sorted using a tuple of *lastUpdateTime*, *taskId*, and *deviceId*.
   * Setting a limit to any number 'x' returns an 'x' number of devices.
   * The *PoolingInterval* can be only a positive integer number.

 *  Sorting in device inventory is allowed for these fields/properties that have a compound index set on: the domain and the field/property itself.
