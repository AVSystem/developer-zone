# Virtual data model - overview

The dialect mechanisms of Coiote DM allows for versatile on-line extensions of the data model to be embedded into the system. One of them - based
on the revolutionary VirtualDM(tm) technology allows the system administrator to virtually extend the data model of the device in order to unify the representation of functionalities as well as fix possible issues with the real data model. To read the high-level description of different stages of the virtual data model, see (#live-data-model-strategies). To learn about the protocol-specific application, see (#lwm2m).
