Sending and receiving messages from LwM2M devices
=================================================

Use the :guilabel:`SMS connector` tab to trigger different operations on a device. You can, for example, get a status of a device, set some parameters or reset them.
The tab is visible only for LwM2M devices which have to have:

 * An active SIM card.
 * MSISDN setting value with a phone number added.

To send a message to a device:

1. Go to :guilabel:`Device inventory`.
2. From a list of devices, select a device to which you want to send a message.
3. Go to the :guilabel:`SMS connector` tab.
4. At the bottom of the view, into the field, type a message that you want to send and click the green icon or use :kbd:`Shift` + :kbd:`Enter`.
