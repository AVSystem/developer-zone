Uninstalling software packages for LwM2M groups
===============================================

Read this instruction to learn how to uninstall software packages for groups of LwM2M devices.

To uninstall a software package from a group of devices:

2. From a list of groups, select a group for which you want to uninstall the software package.
3. Go to the :guilabel:`LwM2M software` tab.
4. Click the :guilabel:`Uninstall` link.
5. Configure your uninstallation:

 * Into the :guilabel:`Package name` field, type a name of a package.
 * Into the :guilabel:`Package version` field, type a package version. Otherwise all packages that have the same name will be uninstalled.
 * Decide on a timeout of your uninstallation (how much time can elapse before it fails) by typing a proper value into the :guilabel:`Timeout in seconds` field.
