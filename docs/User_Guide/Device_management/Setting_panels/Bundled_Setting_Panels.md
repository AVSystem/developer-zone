# Bundled setting panels

Preconfigured panels can be browsed in group management center, in the *root.devicetypes* group. Their definition is overridden at the system start-up, so they should not be changed as modifications will be lost on next system restart. If you want to modify them, they should be overridden for *root.devicetypes* subgroups.

!!! note
    Panels will be shown only if a data model supports such features.
