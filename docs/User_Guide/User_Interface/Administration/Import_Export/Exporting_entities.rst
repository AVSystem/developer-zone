Exporting entities
==================
Read this procedure to learn how to export selected entities.

To export a selected entity:

1. Go to :menuselection:`Administration --> Import/export`.
2. Click the :guilabel:`Export` tab.
3. From the list of entities, select an entity you want to export.

 .. tip:: In a database Quick Fixes and task templates are separate entities so if you export only Quick Fixes but you lose task templates, then these Quick Fixes are useless. The same rule applies to setting value descriptors and setting value categories so if you export only setting value descriptors but you do not have setting value categories, then these setting value descriptors are useless.

4. Select check boxes next to fields you want to export. You can see all fields that you selected in the :guilabel:`Preview` panel.
5. To search through the result, use the :guilabel:`Query` field:

 * To use the simple search, click the magnifying glass icon next to the column in which you want to search for results, type a proper value into the :guilabel:`Query` field and press :kbd:`Enter`. For example, if you click the magnifying glass next to the :guilabel:`ID` column, then type the ID into the :guilabel:`Query` field.
 * To use the advanced search, click the magnifying glass icon next to the :guilabel:`Query` field and use the search.

 .. tip:: To learn more about searching read the :ref:`Search <OG_Search>` section.

6. Click the :guilabel:`Export` link.
