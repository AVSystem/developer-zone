#Exercise 2B: Implement Pre-Shared Key Security Mode

In this exercise, we will change the security mode from **No-Sec** to **Pre-Shared Key** (PSK). In this mode, communication is symmetrically encrypted and authenticated using the same secret key (password), shared between the server and the client.

## Prerequisites

* A Raspberry Pi Pico W board with a USB cable.
* Completed [exercise 1](../academy/exercise1.md) from module 1.
* Completed [exercise 2A](../academy/exercise2a.md) from module 2.
* Installed **minicom** (for Linux), **RealTerm**, **PuTTy** (for Windows), or another serial communication program.
* An active [{{ coiote_short_name }}]({{ coiote_site_link }}/) user account.

## Connect to the LwM2M Server

For LwM2M Servers like [{{ coiote_short_name }}](https://www.avsystem.com/coiote-iot-device-management-platform/), server-side configuration needs to be updated to enable LwM2M Clients to connect using PSK. The simplest solution is to edit the connection parameters on the {{ coiote_long_name }} configuration page. Follow the next steps to change the parameters and set them to Pre-Shared Key mode.


### Change connection parameters

0. Log in to {{ coiote_short_name }}: [{{ coiote_site_link }}]({{ coiote_site_link }}).
0. Select **Device Inventory** from the left-side menu.
0. From the Device Inventory, go to your created device.
0. Go to the **Configuration** page and click the right pencil icon on the Connection parameters panel.

0. Update **Connection parameters**:

    - In the **Security mode** section, select the **Pre-Shared Key** mode:
    - In the **Key identity** field, it‚Äôs recommended to provide the same value as in the **Endpoint name** field.
    - In the **Key field**, create the shared secret used for device-server authentication. During the compilation step you will provide the *PSK_KEY* which must have the same value as the **Key**.

!!! Warning
    Nowadays it‚Äôs easy to guess simple human-generated passwords. Generating a password using a combination of alphanumeric characters and special symbols ensures its security. Avoid putting your personal information and generate a combination of keys to help you maximize safety and security.

Click the **Save** button and confirm the changes.

## Configure credentials in application sources
Let‚Äôs get started by going to the **Anjay-pico-client** directory and creating a new directory called **psk-mode**.

!!! Important
    Copy and paste the **main.c** and **CMakeLists.txt** files from the **Anjay-pico-client/mandatory_objects** directory into the **Anjay-pico-client/psk-mode** directory.

Open the **main.c** file in a code editor (e.g. VS Code).

In this file, modify the `setup_security_object()` function to change Anjay‚Äôs security settings and add the configuration of PSK-based encryption. This can be done using the code below.

<p style="text-align: center;">main.c</p>
```
static int setup_security_object() {
    if (anjay_security_object_install(g_anjay)) {
        return -1;
    }

    static const char psk_identity[] = PSK_IDENTITY;
    static const char psk_key[] = PSK_KEY;

    const anjay_security_instance_t security_instance = {
        .ssid = 1,
        .server_uri = "{{ coaps_uri }}",
        .security_mode = ANJAY_SECURITY_PSK,
        .public_cert_or_psk_identity = (const uint8_t *) psk_identity,
        .public_cert_or_psk_identity_size = strlen(psk_identity),
        .private_cert_or_psk_key = (const uint8_t *) psk_key,
        .private_cert_or_psk_key_size = strlen(psk_key)
    };

    anjay_iid_t security_instance_id = ANJAY_ID_INVALID;
    if (anjay_security_object_add_instance(g_anjay, &security_instance,
                                        &security_instance_id)) {
        return -1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

Next, open the **CMakeLists.txt**, change the file names and add the required information about the PSK mode.

<p style="text-align: center;">CMakeLists.txt</p>
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)

add_executable(psk-mode
               main.c
               )

target_link_libraries(psk-mode
                      pico_stdlib
                      anjay-pico
                      FreeRTOS
                      )

target_include_directories(psk-mode PRIVATE
                           ${COMMON_DIR}/config
                           )

target_compile_definitions(psk-mode PRIVATE
                           WIFI_SSID=\"${WIFI_SSID}\"
                           WIFI_PASSWORD=\"${WIFI_PASSWORD}\"
                           ENDPOINT_NAME=\"${ENDPOINT_NAME}\"
                           PSK_IDENTITY=\"${PSK_IDENTITY}\"
                           PSK_KEY=\"${PSK_KEY}\"
                           )

pico_enable_stdio_usb(psk-mode 1)
pico_enable_stdio_uart(psk-mode 0)

pico_add_extra_outputs(psk-mode)

```

At the end of the file add the mention about subdirectory to the general CMakeLists.txt.
<p style="text-align: center;"> Anjay-pico-client/CMakeLists.txt</p>

```
add_subdirectory(psk-mode)
```

Now the client is ready to be built and connected to LwM2M Server, allowing it to read the Time object.

!!! Important
    Be aware that the **Anjay-pico-client/CMakeLists.txt** and **Anjay-pico-client/psk-mode/CMakeLists.txt** are two different files.

## Configure PSK Identity and Pre-Shared Key
After updating the `setup_security_object()` function in the **main.c** file, it is time to describe the most important variables to configure the **PSK** mode.

- **PSK Identity** (`PSK_IDENTITY`) is the name by which the device identifies itself during the DTLS handshake. It is recommended to use the endpoint name as the Key identity.
- **PSK Key** (`PSK_KEY`) is the shared secret (password) the device uses for server connections in PSK mode. You must enter this PSK Key in plain text.
- **Server URI** (`server_uri`) points to the LwM2M Server. Note that the URI port has changed from `5683` to `5684`.




!!! Note
    The complete code for a similar example targeting desktop platforms can be found in the `secure_communication` subdirectory of the Anjay-pico-client project repository.

## Recompile the application and flash the board
To recompile the application, go to the **Anjay-pico-client/build** directory.

If you‚Äôre using **Linux** or **Mac**, run the following command:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWIFI_SSID="<ssid>" -DWIFI_PASSWORD="<pass>" -DENDPOINT_NAME="<endpoint_name>" -DPSK_IDENTITY="<identity>" -DPSK_KEY="<psk>" ..
```

If you‚Äôre using **Windows**, run the following command:
```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWIFI_SSID="<ssid>" -DWIFI_PASSWORD="<pass>" -DENDPOINT_NAME="<endpoint_name>" -DPSK_IDENTITY="<identity>" -DPSK_KEY="<psk>" .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"
```
Run the following command in the build directory:
```
cmake --build . -j
```

Program your board using the bootloader. Press and hold the **BOOTSEL** button while connecting the device through a USB cable - it should be recognized as a Mass Storage device.

In the **build/psk-mode** directory, you will find the **.uf2** file which contains the added changes.

Copy the `psk-mode.uf2` file to the Mass Storage device directory, and wait until the process finishes - copying the firmware image may take a while.

## Check the logs

If all went well and logs show **registration successfully updated**.

![Check the logs in the serial communication program](images/logs.PNG)

In {{ coiote_long_name }}, the Registration status should show **Registered** and the **Security mode** in the bottom-left corner panel should now include the tag: `Pre-Shared Key`.

![Device in Pre-Shared Key mode Registered](images/pre-shared.png)


Can you see **Registered** in the registration status and the tag **Pre-Shared Key**? If yes, well done!  üëè üëè
