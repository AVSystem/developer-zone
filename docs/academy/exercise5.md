# Graduation Project

Congratulations on your progress in the LwM2M Academy! As you approach graduation, one final task awaits: bringing your IoT idea to life using the LwM2M standard.

Your graduation project involves building an application that utilizes the LwM2M standard and the Coiote IoT Device Management platform. Whether you choose the Raspberry Pi Pico W or any other IoT device, your task is to effectively gather sensor data and establish a cloud connection.

Once your project is complete, please publish the final result on our [AVSystem Discord](https://discord.avsystem.com/) or share it publicly via platforms such as Hackster, Instructables, or your own social media.

**Best of luck with this final step. We can't wait to see how you apply your acquired knowledge to create a compelling end-to-end application.**
