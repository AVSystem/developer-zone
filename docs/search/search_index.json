Prerequisites # An active AWS subscription. A Coiote DM user account with the Cloud admin role. The Git tool ( https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git ). The AWS CLI ( https://aws.amazon.com/cli/ ). Terraform CLI ( https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli ). Create a Coiote DM REST user # To start integrating AWS with Coiote DM, you first need to create a user account that will be used to authorize and authenticate API calls from AWS in Coiote DM. To do that: Go to your Coiote DM account and from the Administration menu, select Users management . Select Add user and in fill in the form: Provide Email for new user (which will be its user name) and select your domain from the Domain path drop-down list. Remember to switch on the User Verified and User Enabled toggle buttons. In the Client Roles field, pick the admin-cli role. Click Save . Go to the Credentials tab, type a password for your user (twice), select Set password , then confirm by clicking Set password in the pop-up. Copy tasks and provide credentials for your device group in Coiote DM # The Coiote DM-side configuration of the integration is located in the dedicated AWSiotCore device group. To complete this side of the integration, log in as the user with the Cloud admin role and follow the steps below: Go to the Device groups panel and select a group: For the default setting, select the AWSiotCore group which already contains all the necessary tasks and setting values. Alternatively, create a new group and migrate the required tasks and setting values: Select the Add button, name your group and click Add . Migrate all the six tasks that have the AWS prefix in their task name: Select the AWSiotCore group and go to Group tasks , select the first AWS task and click Copy . In the pop-up window, click Select group in the Task target field and choose your custom integration group from the list. In the Actions field, select Add new task . Repeat the action for the remaining five tasks. Migrate all the five setting values that have the AWS prefix in their task name: Select your custom integration group and go to Profiles , then select Copy from . In the pop-up window, click Select group and select the AWSiotCore group. Pick all the five AWS setting values from the list by checking them in the Selected column, then click Copy . Enter your AWS subscription credentials in Coiote DM: Go to Device groups , select your custom integration group (or the AWSiotCore group, depending on the previous step) and go to Profiles . Complete the AWS setting values with your AWS credentials: For AWSaccessKeyID and AWSsecretAccessKey : Go to AWS Identity and Access Management , click Users and select your user name from the list. Select the Security credentials tab and, under the Access keys section, click Create access key . Copy the generated Access key ID and Secret access key . In Coiote DM, go to the Profiles tab of your integration group and paste the credentials as values for AWSaccessKeyID and AWSsecretAccessKey . Click Save . For AWSregion : While in AWS IoT Core, click on your region name in the top navigation bar to expand the list of regions. Then, copy the hyphenated region name (e.g. us-east-1 ). In Coiote DM, go to the Profiles tab of your integration group and paste the region name as the value for AWSregion . Click Save . For AWScontrolPlaneEndpointAddress : Go to AWS documentation : https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/iot-core.html . From the Control Plane API Endpoints section, find the endpoint that matches your region (e.g. iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com ) and copy it. In Coiote DM, go to the Profiles tab of your integration group and paste the credentials as the value for AWScontrolPlaneEndpointAddress . Click Save .

Things # Within the AWS IoT Core - Coiote DM integration, things are the AWS representations of LwM2M device entities managed by the Coiote DM platform. They are used to mirror device state, as well as collect, process and act upon device data on the fly using a connection protocol of your choice. Note Things are automatically added to AWS IoT Core upon completing the integration setup and successful device connection. Thing types # Thing types are containers that store configuration and other device-related information shared by all Things of the same type to simplify their bulk management. Within the integration, they are created automatically when a new device is added to AWS from Coiote DM and they are based on device Manufacturer and Model name . In case a new device with a specific Manufacturer and model name pair can be matched with an existing thing type, then it will be associated with it automatically. Note Note that you cannot modify a once created thing type, but you can deprecate (allowing no new devices to be associated with it) or delete it when there are no things associated with a given Thing type. Device Shadows # A device shadow is a structure that stores the device state and represents it in the form of a JSON file, making the device data available to applications and services regardless of device connection to Coiote DM. To synchronize device state information between the Coiote DM and AWS IoT Core, shadows feature the mechanism of reported and desired values. Reported values section - presents the current device state as reported by the device itself (and mediated by Coiote DM) in a JSON file structure within a device shadow. Desired values section - used for requesting changes in the reported section of the device Operation shadow . For the purposes of the integration, a default of three different shadows is established for each connected thing: an unnamed shadow, a datamodel shadow and an operation shadow. Classic Shadow # The Classic shadow (also unnamed shadow) is used for storing connectivity parameters of a LwM2M device (such as registered lifetime, last lifetime refresh, queue mode, LwM2M URI, device registration status etc.). The reported state refreshes upon each change in these parameters that is reported by Coiote DM ( Register or Update message from device). Operation Shadow # The Operation Shadow is where you request your LwM2M operations to be executed. To this end, the desired values of the device state are used. Thus, you can perform any LwM2M 1.0 operation on the device by defining it inside the desired values section. Also, to check if the operation execution was successful, the reported values section of the Operation Shadow is used (but only in case of the READ, WRITE and READ COMPOSITE operations). Communication flow # A value change using the desired device state is formulated as the one below: { \"state\" : { \"desired\" : { \"operation\" : \"write\" , \"keys\" : [ \"LwM2M Server.1.Lifetime\" , \"Device.0.UTC Offset\" ], \"values\" : [ 68 , \"+02:00\" ] } } } Once a value change in the desired section of the operation shadow is saved, a chain of events starts: A change in the desired section triggers the operationRequest rule. The operationRequest rule sends a request to AWS Lambda . AWS Lambda validates the request and forwards it as an event to Coiote DM, making it schedule a task and initiate a device session. Coiote DM communicates with the device. The device responds to Coiote DM with the operation result. Coiote DM forwards the device response back to the Operation Shadow and the results are published in the reported section. The change in the reported section triggers the operationResponse rule. The results are then republished using the operationResponse rule to the Datamodel shadow (but only in case of the READ, WRITE and READ COMPOSITE operations). Datamodel Shadow # The Datamodel Shadow is the place where the cashed data model of the LwM2M device is stored. What this means is that it is a \"read-only shadow\" that keeps the most recent record of the device state as it has been reported by Coiote DM - no device operations can be performed from here. The Datamodel Shadow is updated in case of the following events: Device Register message that comes from Coiote DM, Device Notify and Send messages, Republishing operation results from the Operation shadow to the Datamodel shadow using the operationResponse rule. CloudWatch logs # CloudWatch collects and keeps a record of all the logs generated on the AWS-side of the integration.

Prerequisites # At least one device with active Coiote DM - Azure IoT Hub synchronization . A firmware file hosted on an HTTP server that is reachable by the Coiote DM server. Note In this stage of integration, no authentication method is supported for this endpoint - it is required that the firmware is publicly available (or hosted in a private network but with access granted for the Coiote DM server). Scheduling a firmware upgrade # Introduction # The process of upgrading device firmware for Azure IoT Hub devices synchronized with Coiote DM is based on two main elements: the Azure Direct Method mechanism and the Coiote DM Firmware Upgrade task. In the process, the Azure scheduleFirmwareUpdate direct method is invoked, enabling the Coiote DM to download the specified firmware file and add it to its resources. Then, an XML task is scheduled in Coiote DM and the upgrade is performed on the device. Info For firmware file recognition in Coiote, global identifiers are used. This means that it is recommended to name your firmware files using the format: yourdomainName + randomized value. If the same firmware file name is used again, then Coiote DM will be able to utilize the once downloaded resource without the need to download it again. Step 1: Invoking the Azure scheduleFirmwareUpdate direct method # To initiate the firmware upgrade procedure for your device: Go to your Azure hub account and under Explorers , select IoT devices . From the list, choose the device for which you want to upgrade the firmware. In the device view, select the Direct Method tab. Provide data for the following fields: Method Name - paste the scheduleFirmwareUpdate direct method name here. Payload - use the following payload with firmware upgrade parameters (remember to replace the example values where needed): { \"name\": \"anjay-firmware\", \"firmwareUrl\": \"https://example.repository.com/artifactory/gitlfs/demo.fw-pkg\", // optional - default=\"1200s\", any valid duration in format \"<length><unit>\" \"timeout\": \"1200s\", // optional - default=\"COAP\" \"protocolType\": \"COAP\", // optional - default=null <-> keep firmware file forever, any valid duration in format \"<length><unit>\" or null \"retentionPeriod\": \"300s\", // optional - default=\"\" \"description\": \"This is anjay demo firmware\", // optional - default=false \"useQuota\": false, // optional - default=false \"useCachedData\": false, // optional - default=false \"resumeAfterDownlinkFailure\": false, // optional - default=\"pull\", possible values = [\"pull\", \"push\"] \"imageDeliveryMethod\": \"pull\", // optional - default=\"WithoutObservations\", possible values = [\"ObservationTrigger\", \"WithoutObservations\", \"ObservationBased\", \"SendBased\"] \"upgradeStrategy\": \"WithoutObservations\", // optional - default=\"always\", possible values = [\"always\", \"weekends\", \"nights-home\", \"nights-enterprise-weekends\", \"nights-enterprise\", user-defined schedules] \"schedule\": \"always\" } Connection timeout - specify a timeout for the Azure - Coiote DM connection (the recommended value is not less than 5 seconds). Method timeout - specify a timeout for direct method result notification. Once you have provided the required data, click Invoke method . After a short moment, you should be able to see the direct method result in the Result field. The 200 as the \"status\" parameter value means that the firmware upgrade task was completed successfully. Importantly, the result \"payload\" value will be needed for other FOTA actions like status check or cancellation, so be sure to copy it to your clipboard if needed. Tip Out of all the parameters provided in Firmware upgrade direct method payload, only two are mandatory: name - the unique file name used for firmware identification. firmwareUrl - the URL used by Coiote DM to download the firmware file and include it as a resource. Therefore it is correct to include only those two in the payload, as in here: { \"name\": \"anjay-firmware\", \"firmwareUrl\": \"https://example.repository.com/artifactory/gitlfs/demo.fw-pkg\", } Step 2: Checking the firmware upgrade result # To check the status of a scheduled firmware upgrade, follow these steps: In the Direct Method tab of your device, provide data for the following fields: Method Name - paste the checkFirmwareUpdateStatus direct method name here. Payload - use the payload displayed in the Firmware upgrade result field (remember to replace the placeholder value with your copied value): { \"fotaId\": \"fotaIdReturnedByScheduleOperation\" } Click Invoke method . Check the direct method status in the Result field: Step 3: Checking Coiote DM FOTA task execution # Once you have executed the Azure-side steps of the procedure, you can check its status from the side of Coiote DM. Go to your Coiote DM account and in the Device Inventory , select your device. In the Device Management Center, enter the LwM2M firmware tab. Check the status of the FOTA task execution for your device: In the Current firmware section, check if the device firmware is updated to the newest version. In the Installation history section, check if the lwm2mFirmwareUpdate task invoked earlier by the Azure scheduleFirmwareUpdate direct method has been completed with success. Cancelling the firmware upgrade procedure # To cancel the firmware upgrade procedure, follow these steps: In the Direct Method tab of your device, provide data for the following fields: Method Name - paste the cancelFirmwareUpdate direct method name here. Payload - use the payload displayed in the Firmware upgrade result field (remember to replace the placeholder value with your copied value): { \"fotaId\": \"fotaIdReturnedByScheduleOperation\" } Click Invoke method . Check the direct method status in the Result field: See also # See the relevant section of LwM2M mappings to learn the details of how Azure IoT Hub Direct Methods are mapped in Coiote DM.","title":"Upgrading device firmware"},{"location":"Azure_IoT_Integration_Guide/Azure_IoT_Hub_integration/Device_operations/Upgrading_firmware/#upgrading-device-firmware","text":"If you would like to upgrade the firmware of devices using the Azure IoT Hub, follow the instruction below.","title":"Upgrading device firmware"},{"location":"Azure_IoT_Integration_Guide/Azure_IoT_Hub_integration/Device_operations/Upgrading_firmware/#prerequisites","text":"At least one device with active Coiote DM - Azure IoT Hub synchronization .

Introduction # The LwM2M protocol data model is organized as a three-level tree that has the following structure: object (e.g. a 'temperature sensor') object instance (e.g. 'temperature sensor #1', 'temperature sensor #2' etc.) resource (e.g. 'current temperature value') In terms of operations that can be performed on an LwM2M Client, an LwM2M Server can READ all of the data model entities, and, depending on their characteristics, may also WRITE to some of them, and EXECUTE some of them. Additionally, an LwM2M Server can also OBSERVE selected resources. Info If you would like to dive deeper into the details of the Lightweight M2M protocol, please refer to our brief introduction to LwM2M . This division into readable, writable, executable and observable data model entities is the basis for the mapping of LwM2M resources (as interpreted by Coiote DM) into Azure IoT Hub data processing mechanisms. LwM2M readable and writable resources # Within the Coiote DM - Azure IoT Hub integration, readable and writable resources are usually interpreted as part of Azure Device twin data structure. Note To learn more about Device twins, go to the Understand and use Device twins section of the Azure IoT Hub documentation. For instance, the sample JSON snippet below is a tree with nested resources to represent a fragment of the LwM2M data model with path /3/1/1 : { \"deviceId\": \"airquality-0\", ... \"properties\": { \"reported\": { \"lwm2m\": { \"1\": { \"0\": { \"0\": {}, \"1\": { \"value\": 90 }, \"4\": {}, \"6\": {}, \"7\": {}, \"8\": {} } }, \"3\": { \"1\": { \"1\": { \"value\": \"airquality-0-Valparaiso\" } } }, ... READ - Communication flow # Data model resources that are read-only, such as Manufacturer (with ID 3/0/0 ) will be mapped into the Device twin as a reported property. WRITE - Communication flow # On the other hand, a writable resource, such as Lifetime (with ID 1/0/1 ), apart from being represented as a reported property, can be additionally mapped as a desired property. This enables you to synchronize the device data model and configuration between Azure and Coiote DM. Changing the value of a writable resource involves creating a properly formatted JSON snippet in the desired property field within the Device twin that introduces a value change: ... \"properties\": { \"desired\": { \"lwm2m\": { \"1\": { \"0\": { \"0\": {}, \"1\": { \"value\": 30 } } } }, ... After JSON is saved, Azure notifies Coiote DM of the desired change which is then transferred to the device in form of a WRITE command. Once the value is changed on the device, Coiote DM reports back to Azure that the value of the corresponding reported property should be updated in the Device twin JSON structure. LwM2M executable resources # As a rule, LwM2M resources that can be executable translate into Direct methods in Azure IoT Hub. This means that by invoking a direct method from Azure, you can trigger an EXECUTE operation on a chosen resource available for your device and the request will be transferred immediately by the LwM2M Server to the device. Note To learn more about Direct methods, go to the Understand Direct methods section of the Azure IoT Hub documentation. An executable LwM2M resource ID is mapped to a direct method in the following way: method name: execute { path: \"object.objectInstance.resource\", [args: \"optional arguments to execute\"] } Thus, for instance, to execute a factory reset on a device, you need to invoke a direct method with the execute name and the following payload: { path: \"3.0.5\" } EXECUTE - Communication flow # Invoking a direct method from Azure IoT Hub and handling it by Coiote DM in the form of an EXECUTE operation passed to the device has the following flow: LwM2M observable resources # In Coiote DM, some of the resources within the device data model can be observed for changes in value. These are generally resources related to telemetry data or other measurements. Their value changes can be monitored by Coiote DM and reported to the Azure IoT Hub Device-to-cloud mechanism. Note To learn more about the Azure Device-to-cloud, go to sending device-to-cloud messages section of the Azure IoT Hub documentation. Observe - Communication flow # Setting an Observe operation on a resource in Coiote DM, for instance a temperature reading, will result in a Notify message sent by the device upon value change that Coiote DM will transfer to the Device-to-cloud mechanism of Azure IoT Hub. What is more, you can set observations on LwM2M resources from the Azure IoT Hub level by adding appropriate attributes to the resource as a Device twin desired property. For instance, an Observe operation on resource ID 3303/1/5700 is set in the following way: ... \"properties\": { \"desired\": { \"lwm2m\": { \"3303\": { \"1\": { \"5700\": { \"observed\": true, \"attributes\": { \"pmin\": 60 } } } } } ... After JSON is saved, Azure notifies Coiote DM of the desired attribute setting which is then transferred to the device in form of an Observe operation.

While some are used for the communication between the Server and the LwM2M test device, others help to define the test case logic. Read this chapter to learn how to use Actions in the configuration of customizable interoperability test cases. Action attributes # All the available Actions are defined using a set of configurable attributes that you can specify while adding or editing a test case. The attributes available under each action are determined by the type of given Action. However, to set up a test case, not all attributes are mandatory. The general rule is that if you leave an optional attribute\u2019s field blank, the final test case result won\u2019t be affected in any way. Tip if you would like to make the test device ignore a particular attribute so that it doesn\u2019t answer to the server request, type None in the optional attribute\u2019s field. Description of Actions # Within the Server simulator test cases, the following Actions are available (with mandatory attributes written in bold): READ WRITE EXECUTE DISCOVER DELETE CREATE WRITE ATTRIBUTES CLEAR ATTRIBUTES OBSERVE CANCEL OBSERVE Firmware Update Wait Pause response Wait for uplink request Send paused response Start Notification recording Expect Notification Loop start READ # READ is used to access the value of an object, object instances, a resource and single resource instances. You can define it using four attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter you want to read. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected value \u2013 if the value you enter here equals the value read from the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the value will only show up in the test case log and it will have no impact on the test case result. Note that this READ attribute works only for Resources and Resource Instances. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. LwM2M: Requested content format \u2013 the content format of the device answer that you request for your read operation. If the device doesn\u2019t support the requested format, the test will fail. If left blank, the device can decide what content format to use; any format will be accepted. WRITE # WRITE is used to change the value of a Resource. You can define it using four attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you want to set a new value or overwrite the existing one. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Value \u2013 the value you enter here sets a new value or overwrites the existing one. If left blank, the existing value will be kept and the test will be passed. LwM2M: Content format \u2013 the content format in which you send the write request to the device. If the device doesn\u2019t support the specified format, the test will fail. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. EXECUTE # EXECUTE is used to initiate some action and can only be performed on individual Resources. If the device receives an EXECUTE for an Object Instance(s) or Resource Instance(s), it will return an error. You can define it using two attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will issue an execute. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Execute arguments \u2013 the execution arguments passed to the device expressed in Plain Text format. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. DISCOVER # DISCOVER is used to discover LwM2M Attributes attached to an Object, Object Instances, and Resources. You can define it using two attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter whose attributes you want to discover. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter.

If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. CREATE # CREATE is used by the Server simulator to create Object Instance(s) within the LwM2M Client. You can define the action using three parameters and a set of Object Instance-dependent values: Object ID or name \u2013 the Object that you want to create an Instance for. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Portfolio\u2019) or the numerical (e.g. \u201816\u2019) value of the parameter. LwM2M: Instance number \u2013 the number assigned to the Object Instance to be created. If left blank, the number will be chosen by the device. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Resources \u2013 click the Provide initial values button to view and specify the possible Resources and Resource Instances of the Object Instance to be created. Note that if the values marked as required are left blank, the action will fail for devices that correctly implement LwM2M. WRITE ATTRIBUTES # WRITE ATTRIBUTES is used to attach metadata containing parameters for Notifications to an Object, an Object Instance or a Resource. You can define it using seven attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will write attributes. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed.

Maximum period \u2013 the minimum time in seconds that the device waits between two notifications. Value greater than \u2013 notifications will be sent only when the monitored value crosses the threshold you set here. However, please note that the interpretation of this parameter may differ depending on the specific LwM2M Client implementation. Value less than \u2013 notifications will be sent only when the monitored value crosses the threshold you set here. However, please note that the interpretation of this parameter may differ depending on the specific LwM2M Client implementation. Step \u2013 the minimum change value between two notifications. CLEAR ATTRIBUTES # CLEAR ATTRIBUTES is used to clear the metadata attached to an Object, an Object Instance or a Resource which contain parameters for Notifications. You can define it using seven attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will clear attributes. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Clear minimum period \u2013 if set to true, it clears the minimum time in seconds between two notifications. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear maximum period \u2013 if set to true, it clears the maximum time set between two notifications. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear value greater than \u2013 if set to true, it clears the threshold set for the monitored value. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear value less than \u2013 if set to true, it clears the threshold set for the monitored value. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear step \u2013 if set to true, it clears the minimum change value between two notifications. If set to false, the value is kept. OBSERVE # OBSERVE is used to initiate an observation request for changes of a specific Resource, Resources within an Object Instance or for all the Object Instances of an Object. You can define it using four attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter whose value(s) you will observe. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Fail if already observed \u2013 if set to true, the test will fail in case there is an existing observation set on this parameter. In case there is no observation set, your observe request should be accepted and the test won\u2019t fail. If set to false, any existing observations will be cancelled and requested again by this one and the test will be passed. LwM2M: Content format \u2013 the content format in which you send the OBSERVE request to the device. If the device doesn\u2019t support the specified format, the test will fail. CANCEL OBSERVE # CANCEL OBSERVE is used to cancel an observation. You can define it using three attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will cancel an existing observation. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Cancel type \u2013 the mode in which the CANCEL OBSERVE will be sent to the device. o ACTIVE - CANCEL OBSERVE is sent to the device immediately. o PASSIVE - CoAP RESET is sent in response to the next notification message received from the device. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Firmware Update # Firmware Update is used to perform a firmware update operation on the test device. You can define it using five attributes: Firmware \u2013 the ID of the resource used as the firmware source. Update timeout \u2013 the time period in seconds within which the firmware update should be completed. In case the timeout is up and the update process has not finished, the action will fail. Delivery method \u2013 The protocol and transfer method used to deliver the firmware file to the device. Use notifications \u2013 if set to true, an OBSERVE will be issued automatically for the \u2018State\u2019 and \u2018Update result\u2019 parameters while upgrading the device. The notifications returned by the device will be visible in the test case logs. Expected update result \u2013 if the update result you enter here equals the result returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default result defined by the LwM2M standard. You can choose among the ten update results defined as per the LwM2M protocol specification. WAIT # Wait is used to set the waiting time before executing the next action. You can define it using two attributes: Waiting time \u2013 the interval set before the next action is executed. In progress message \u2013 a custom text that will be displayed as the test case progress message while waiting for the execution of the next action. Pause response # Pause response is used to delay a response to be sent to the device. If set, the server will wait before sending the response until the Send paused response action is executed. Request type \u2013 the kind of request for which you want to pause the response. Wait for uplink request # Wait for uplink request is used to prevent the server from executing any tasks or actions until an uplink request arrives from the device. You can define the action using three attributes: Request type to wait for \u2013 the kind of request you want to wait for. Timeout \u2013 the time period in seconds within which the uplink request should arrive. In case the timeout is up with no request, the action will fail. Waiting message \u2013 the message displayed during the test case execution while waiting for the arrival of the uplink request. Send paused response # Send paused response is used to send the previously paused response to the device. Request type \u2013 the kind of request for which you want to send the previously paused response. Start Notification recording # Start Notification recording is used to make the Server simulator save all notifications received from the device in its memory. The limit of recorded notifications can be configured using the ddscNotificationRecordingLimit setting value. Once the limit is reached, new notifications are not recorded. Execute the Start Notification recording action again in the same test to clear the recording state and to be able to match more notifications than the recording limit. Expect Notification # Expect Notification is used to check if recorded Notifications match the required criteria. You can define it using five attributes: Expected path \u2013 only notifications that were received on this path will be validated. In case of a notification with multiple paths and values, each path and value are treated as separate notifications. Expected value \u2013 use it to check if there is any notification that has a given value and matches all other criteria. Expected arrival order \u2013 use it to limit the validation only to one notification on a given path that arrived in a given order since the last Start Notification recording action. Note that the counting starts from 0 and that the Observe response is also counted if it is executed after the recording action started. Timeout \u2013 if the expected notification does not arrive within this time limit, the action will fail. Waiting message \u2013 a custom text that will be displayed as the test case progress message while waiting for the action execution. Loop start # Loop start is used to repeat an action or a set of actions within a test case. Note that when configuring the first action inside the loop, the Loop end action is added automatically. Repetitions \u2013 the number of iterations of action(s) inside the loop.","title":"Test case actions"},{"location":"Interoperability_tests_guide/Test_case_actions/#test-case-actions","text":"","title":"Test case actions"},{"location":"Interoperability_tests_guide/Test_case_actions/#introduction","text":"Based on the LwM2M 1.0 standard protocol operations, Actions are steps that can be defined within a test case.

GitLab - configure and run pipeline # Coiote DM interop tests API can also be integrated with GitLab using the GitLab's CI/CD toolset. Here is how to do it: Upload the gitlab-ci.yml file that will define your GitLab pipeline to your project repository: Edit the script where required to adjust it to your environment: Note Remember to change the name example_filename.py to your custom name that you will choose in the next step. Also, keep in mind that running a pipeline in GitLab requires a docker image of a Linux distribution (or any operating system that can run python script). image : name : example.repository.com/docker-local/linux_image protocol-tests : stage : test script : - python3 example_filename.py artifacts : when : always paths : - report.xml reports : junit : report.xml Save the file as gitlab-ci.yml and upload it to the chosen branch of your project repository. Follow Step 2 from Creating a Jenkins multibranch pipeline (uploading a file with python script to your GitLab repository). Run a created pipeline for your project: Go to your GitLab project and in the Dashboard view, select CI/CD from the menu on the left and click Pipelines . Attention Note that to be able to run a pipeline, you will need to have the GitLab CI/CD toolset configured. For details, please check https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/index.html . You should be able to see the branch with the uploaded gitlab-ci.yml file. Select the Run pipeline button, then confirm again by clicking Run pipeline . Once the pipeline execution is finished, you should be able to see the results in the Tests tab of your pipeline.

Here is how to do it: Upload the gitlab-ci.yml file that will define your GitLab pipeline to your project repository: Edit the script where required to adjust it to your environment: Note Remember to change the name example_filename.py to your custom name that you will choose in the next step. Also, keep in mind that running a pipeline in GitLab requires a docker image of a Linux distribution (or any operating system that can run python script). image : name : example.repository.com/docker-local/linux_image protocol-tests : stage : test script : - python3 example_filename.py artifacts : when : always paths : - report.xml reports : junit : report.xml Save the file as gitlab-ci.yml and upload it to the chosen branch of your project repository. Follow Step 2 from Creating a Jenkins multibranch pipeline (uploading a file with python script to your GitLab repository). Run a created pipeline for your project: Go to your GitLab project and in the Dashboard view, select CI/CD from the menu on the left and click Pipelines . Attention Note that to be able to run a pipeline, you will need to have the GitLab CI/CD toolset configured. For details, please check https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/index.html . You should be able to see the branch with the uploaded gitlab-ci.yml file. Select the Run pipeline button, then confirm again by clicking Run pipeline . Once the pipeline execution is finished, you should be able to see the results in the Tests tab of your pipeline. Note Viewing graphs with test results is not supported in GitLab by default as it requires additional plugins.","title":"GitLab - configure and run pipeline"}]}
