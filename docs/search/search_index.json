To add the resources needed for the integration to your AWS services: Go to the AWS Console page ( https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home ) and sign in. Make sure that you are in the right region. From the list of services, select CloudFormation . Create a new stack. Use the template of Amazon S3 URL from below and change placeholders [REGION-NAME] to the one you use and is supported . https://coiote-aws-int-[REGION-NAME].s3.[REGION-NAME].amazonaws.com/coiote-aws-integration-cf-template.json Choose a name for the stack and provide the parameters: Important The credentials you provide at this point should belong to the user with access to the Coiote DM group which stores the AWS configuration set in a previous step. coioteDMrestUsername - username of the created CoioteDM account. coioteDMrestPassword - password of the created CoioteDM account. coioteDMrestUri - URL address and port of your Coiote DM installation. The port should always be 8088 to enable proper mTLS-based authentication. Note For some installations, port is not required. If you don't know what port to choose, contact our support. Finalize configuring the stack and wait for its creation to finish. Once the stack is created successfully, the devices in your integration group will be automatically migrated to the AWS IoT Core.

Things # Within the AWS IoT Core - Coiote DM integration, things are the AWS representations of LwM2M device entities managed by the Coiote DM platform. They are used to mirror device state, as well as collect, process and act upon device data on the fly using a connection protocol of your choice. Note Things are automatically added to AWS IoT Core upon completing the integration setup and successful device connection. Thing types # Thing types are containers that store configuration and other device-related information shared by all Things of the same type to simplify their bulk management. Within the integration, they are created automatically when a new device is added to AWS from Coiote DM and they are based on device Manufacturer and Model name . In case a new device with a specific Manufacturer and model name pair can be matched with an existing thing type, then it will be associated with it automatically. Note Note that you cannot modify a once created thing type, but you can deprecate (allowing no new devices to be associated with it) or delete it when there are no things associated with a given Thing type. Device Shadows # A device shadow is a structure that stores the device state and represents it in the form of a JSON file, making the device data available to applications and services regardless of device connection to Coiote DM. To synchronize device state information between the Coiote DM and AWS IoT Core, shadows feature the mechanism of reported and desired values. Reported values section - presents the current device state as reported by the device itself (and mediated by Coiote DM) in a JSON file structure within a device shadow. Desired values section - used for requesting changes in the reported section of the device Operation shadow . For the purposes of the integration, a default of three different shadows is established for each connected thing: an unnamed shadow, a datamodel shadow and an operation shadow. Classic Shadow # The Classic shadow (also unnamed shadow) is used for storing connectivity parameters of a LwM2M device (such as registered lifetime, last lifetime refresh, queue mode, LwM2M URI, device registration status etc.). The reported state refreshes upon each change in these parameters that is reported by Coiote DM ( Register or Update message from device). Operation Shadow # The Operation Shadow is where you request your LwM2M operations to be executed. To this end, the desired values of the device state are used. Thus, you can perform any LwM2M 1.0 operation on the device by defining it inside the desired values section. Also, to check if the operation execution was successful, the reported values section of the Operation Shadow is used (but only in case of the READ, WRITE and READ COMPOSITE operations). Communication flow # A value change using the desired device state is formulated as the one below: { \"state\" : { \"desired\" : { \"operation\" : \"write\" , \"keys\" : [ \"LwM2M Server.1.Lifetime\" , \"Device.0.UTC Offset\" ], \"values\" : [ 68 , \"+02:00\" ] } } } Once a value change in the desired section of the operation shadow is saved, a chain of events starts: A change in the desired section triggers the operationRequest rule. The operationRequest rule sends a request to AWS Lambda . AWS Lambda validates the request and forwards it as an event to Coiote DM, making it schedule a task and initiate a device session. Coiote DM communicates with the device. The device responds to Coiote DM with the operation result. Coiote DM forwards the device response back to the Operation Shadow and the results are published in the reported section. The change in the reported section triggers the operationResponse rule. The results are then republished using the operationResponse rule to the Datamodel shadow (but only in case of the READ, WRITE and READ COMPOSITE operations). Datamodel Shadow # The Datamodel Shadow is the place where the cashed data model of the LwM2M device is stored. What this means is that it is a \"read-only shadow\" that keeps the most recent record of the device state as it has been reported by Coiote DM - no device operations can be performed from here. The Datamodel Shadow is updated in case of the following events: Device Register message that comes from Coiote DM, Device Notify and Send messages, Republishing operation results from the Operation shadow to the Datamodel shadow using the operationResponse rule. CloudWatch logs # CloudWatch collects and keeps a record of all the logs generated on the AWS-side of the integration.

Setting an Observation lets your devices know what value changes and for what particular resources they need to notify you about. An Observation can be set for any or all the components of the data model : objects, objects instances, and resources. Whenever there is a change in values, a device will send a Notify message to Coiote DM, which in turn will transfer it to Azure IoT Central. In this section, you learn how to: Assign a device template that acts as a translator between Coiote DM and Azure IoT Central. Create a device group in Azure IoT Central, because an Observation is set at the group level. Run Jobs to add, edit or delete Observations. See value changes for the observed resources. Prerequisites # An active Azure IoT Central with hub owner access permissions. A Coiote DM user account with permissions to use the Azure IoT Central integration. A device group created in Coiote DM. A configured integration between Coiote DM and Azure Iot Central . A configured integration template in Coiote DM, assigned to the device group . A connected device in Coiote DM that has been exported to or imported from Azure IoT Central. Assign a device template # To enable correct communication between Coiote DM and Azure IoT Central, you need two templates. The first template configures the Coiote DM integration with Azure. ( Follow the instruction to learn how to configure it.) The second template builds on the first one and allows to provide information that is used only in Azure IoT Central. For example: a given resource is temperature and is measured in Celsius. Download LwM2M template in Coiote DM # In Coiote DM, go to Administration \u2192 Hyperscaler Integration Center and select the Templates tab. In the list of templates, find the one from which you want to generate the IoT Central template. Attention The template must contain the objects that you want to observe. For example, the Velocity object is contained in the Default rich LwM2M schema template that we use in this tutorial. Click Generate Azure IoT Central template to download the template as a JSON file. Info Default minimal LwM2M schema and Default rich LwM2M schema are the default Azure integration templates that you can use to generate a template for Azure IoT Central. Default minimal LwM2M schema contains only two objects: LwM2M Server and Device that are necessary to connect a device to a LwM2M server. Default rich LwM2M schema contains some additional objects that describe the current state of a device. You can use these default templates to test your integration or for some basic operations. If your device contains other LwM2M objects, then you need to create a new template or copy and edit on of the default templates. Create a device template in Azure IoT Central # From the Overview tab of your Azure IoT Central account, go to IoT Central Application URL . To add a new device template, go to Device templates from the left pane and then click + New . On the Select type page, select the IoT device tile and click Next: Customize . Enter a name for your device template and click Next: Review . Leave the checkbox unticked. In this example, our device template is called template_test_name . On the Review page, click Create . Now you'll be prompted to create a model for your template. Select the Import a model tile. This is where you import the .JSON file you exported from Coiote DM. To publish this device template to the application, click Publish on the Model page. Assign a device template in Azure IoT Central # To assign the published template to a device, go to Devices from the left pane and click on the device you want to observe. In our case, the device is called soilquality . Click Manage templates and choose Assign template . In the dialog that appears, find the template you have previously created in Azure (in our case, this is template_test_name ) and click Assign template . Create a group # Now that you have a device with a template assigned to it, you need to add this device to a group. To create a group: In Azure IoT Central, go to Device groups from the left pane and click + New . Note A device group can only contain devices from a single device template. Fill in the following information: Group name and an optional description. In our case, the group is called device_group_test . Device group access : skip, because LwM2M test application doesn\u2019t use organizations. Create a device query : from the Value drop-down menu, select the name of the device template you created in the previous step ( template_test_name ). Click Run query . After running a query, you'll see the list of devices that are associated with this template. In our case it\u2019s the device called soilquality . Click Save . Set up an Observation # Let\u2019s set an Observation operation on resource ID 6/0/4 . This is Velocity, and the data is sent as Telemetry. To add an Observation, you need to use the Jobs tab. In Azure IoT Central, go to Jobs from the left pane and click + New job . Now configure your job: Name *: Provide a name and an optional description of the job. Access : skip, because LwM2M test application doesn\u2019t use organizations. Target devices : select the device group this job will run on. In our case this is device_group_test . Job properties : Set Job type as Property . Under the Name field, select Velocity attribute / Observed and turn the toggle to True . Add the attributes to this observation. Click + Add and select Velocity attributes / Observation attributes / <name> from the drop-down menu. In the dialog that appears, specify the name of the attribute: pmin . Close the dialog. Enter a value of Velocity attributes / Observation attributes / pmin . In this tutorial the value is set at 1 , which means that notifications will be sent every second. Click Next . Info pmin - the minimum time in seconds between two notifications. pmax - the maximum time in seconds between two notifications. The notification is sent even if the value didn't change. Read more about other attributes in our Brief description of OMA LwM2M . In Delivery options , click Next . In Schedule , click Next . Review the job: n6n0n4 stands for Velocity. Note that objects, object instances, and resources are separated by n in Azure IoT Central. observed is set at true The attribute pmin is set at 1 second. Click Run . See the value changes in Azure IoT Central # In Azure IoT Central, go to Devices from the left pane and click on the device you're observing. You'll see the list of messages that notify about any changes in the desired and reported properties for this device. In the Raw data tab, unfold one of the recent messages. Note that this tab contains all the messages received from your device, and some of them might relate to other objects. Look for a recent message where the JSON snippet contains the information that the Observation has been set for the telemetry resource n6n0n4 (Velocity). To see the data received about the value changes, scroll right until you see the Velocity column. Tip If you don\u2019t see any value in the relevant column (e.g., Velocity), scroll all the way right to the very last column Unmodeled data . If it contains an entry similar to {\"n6n0n4\":\"1634741504000\"} , it means there is a mismatch between Coiote DM and the Azure IoT Central templates. Velocity is a Telemetry resource, but apparently it's set as Property in Azure. To fix this error, go to Device templates in Azure IoT Central, select the relevant template and find the resource you want to edit. In the Capability type column, select Telemetry from the drop-down menu so that it\u2019s consistent with what you have in Coiote DM. Click Save . Go back to Devices and refresh the page to see the changes. Edit or delete an Observation # To edit or delete an Observation, you need to create a new job. In Azure IoT Central, go to Jobs from the left pane and click + New job . Alternatively, you can copy an existing job: Select the job and then click Copy job . To edit the Observation attributes , change the value in the text box. To change the map keys (e.g., pmax to pmin), click on the Ellipse button. To delete an Observation, turn off the toggle to False . Check an Observation in Coiote DM # This step is optional. If you want to make sure that the Observation has been set in Coiote DM as well, do the following: In Coiote DM, go to Device inventory and click on the observed device. From the left pane of the device panel, go to Objects . Find the resource you want to check. In our example, this is 4 Velocity resource in the 6 Location object. Click the refresh button to the left from the Value tracking . You'll see that checkboxes next to Value tracking and Attributes are now filled in green.

Azure DPS ensures high availability by providing load balancing across multiple hubs and supporting reprovisioning based on a change in the device. For more information about Azure DPS, refer to the official documentation . Coiote DM communicates with Azure DPS to add a device to the right IoT hub and then receives the credentials to connect to the selected hub. To enable communication between Azure DPS and Coiote DM, you first need to connect them using the Hyperscaler Integration Center in Coiote DM. Follow the instruction below to learn how to do it. Prerequisites # An active DPS with linked IoT hubs . An active IoT Hub with hub owner access permissions. Read here how to create a hub. A Coiote DM user account with permissions to use the Azure DPS integration. Create an Enrollment group # This step describes how to create an Enrollment group. If you already have one, proceed to the Get the credentials section. A device can be enrolled in Azure DPS either individually or as a group of devices that share a specific attestation mechanism. Currently, Coiote DM doesn't support Individual Enrollments, so you need to choose the Enrollment group option. To create an Enrollment group: Log in to the Azure portal and click on your Device Provisioning Service . Go to Manage enrollments from the left pane. Click + Add enrollment group . Provide the group name and select the Symmetric key option from the Attestation Type. Make sure that the Auto-generate keys checkbox is ticked. Click Save .

Setting an Observation lets your devices know what value changes and for what particular resources they need to notify you about. An Observation can be set for any or all the components of the data model : objects, objects instances, and resources. Whenever there is a change in values, a device will send a Notify message to Coiote DM, which in turn will transfer it to Azure IoT Hub.

Both of them are Properties. In Azure IoT Hub, value changes for both Telemetry and Property are stored in Device twin , because Observation is a Property in itself and it does not keep track of historical changes in values. To set an Observation, do the following: In your Azure IoT Hub account, go to Devices from the left pane. Click on the device and then go to Device twin . Find the desired property in the JSON snippet. This is where you define what needs to be observed. To set an Observation on object 1/1 (Lifetime) and resource 3/0/13 (Current time) , add the following fragment under the \"desired\": { property: \"lwm2m\": { \"1\": { \"1\": { \"observed\": true, \"attributes\": { \"pmin\": 60 } } }, \"3\": { \"0\": { \"13\": { \"observed\": true, \"attributes\": { \"pmin\": 1 } } } } }, The line with \u201cobserved\u201d: true sets an Observation.

Info pmin - the minimum time in seconds between two notifications. pmax - the maximum time in seconds between two notifications. The notification is sent even if the value didn't change. Read more about other attributes in our Brief description of OMA LwM2M . Click Save . See value changes # In Azure IoT Hub # The value changes for the observed object and resource are displayed in the same JSON snippet where you set an Observation. Scroll down to the Reported property and find the value line. \"13\": { \"value\": 1634653218000, \"attributes\": { \"pmin\": \"1\" }, \"observed\": true } Because we have specified in the Desired properties that the maximum time between two notifications for the Current time (3/0/13) resource is 1 second ( pmax: 1 ), the number next to value will be changing every 1 second. E.g., 163465321 8 000 will become 163465321 9 000. If you don\u2019t see any changes, click Refresh . If it doesn\u2019t help, you can check whether observation has been set in Coiote DM as well.

Note In this stage of integration, no authentication method is supported for this endpoint - it is required that the firmware is publicly available (or hosted in a private network but with access granted for the Coiote DM server). Scheduling a firmware upgrade # Introduction # The process of upgrading device firmware for Azure IoT Hub devices synchronized with Coiote DM is based on two main elements: the Azure Direct Method mechanism and the Coiote DM Firmware Upgrade task. In the process, the Azure scheduleFirmwareUpdate direct method is invoked, enabling the Coiote DM to download the specified firmware file and add it to its resources. Then, an XML task is scheduled in Coiote DM and the upgrade is performed on the device. Info For firmware file recognition in Coiote, global identifiers are used. This means that it is recommended to name your firmware files using the format: yourdomainName + randomized value. If the same firmware file name is used again, then Coiote DM will be able to utilize the once downloaded resource without the need to download it again. Step 1: Invoking the Azure scheduleFirmwareUpdate direct method # To initiate the firmware upgrade procedure for your device: Go to your Azure hub account and under Explorers , select IoT devices . From the list, choose the device for which you want to upgrade the firmware. In the device view, select the Direct Method tab. Provide data for the following fields: Method Name - paste the scheduleFirmwareUpdate direct method name here. Payload - use the following payload with firmware upgrade parameters (remember to replace the example values where needed): { \"name\": \"anjay-firmware\", \"firmwareUrl\": \"https://example.repository.com/artifactory/gitlfs/demo.fw-pkg\", // optional - default=\"1200s\", any valid duration in format \"<length><unit>\" \"timeout\": \"1200s\", // optional - default=\"COAP\" \"protocolType\": \"COAP\", // optional - default=null <-> keep firmware file forever, any valid duration in format \"<length><unit>\" or null \"retentionPeriod\": \"300s\", // optional - default=\"\" \"description\": \"This is anjay demo firmware\", // optional - default=false \"useQuota\": false, // optional - default=false \"useCachedData\": false, // optional - default=false \"resumeAfterDownlinkFailure\": false, // optional - default=\"pull\", possible values = [\"pull\", \"push\"] \"imageDeliveryMethod\": \"pull\", // optional - default=\"WithoutObservations\", possible values = [\"ObservationTrigger\", \"WithoutObservations\", \"ObservationBased\", \"SendBased\"] \"upgradeStrategy\": \"WithoutObservations\", // optional - default=\"always\", possible values = [\"always\", \"weekends\", \"nights-home\", \"nights-enterprise-weekends\", \"nights-enterprise\", user-defined schedules] \"schedule\": \"always\" } Connection timeout - specify a timeout for the Azure - Coiote DM connection (the recommended value is not less than 5 seconds).

These processing mechanisms of Azure IoT Central have the same names as data formats in Coiote DM: Properties, Command, and Telemetry. Properties describe the actual value, Command executes commands, and Telemetry observes changes in values over time. Introduction # The LwM2M protocol data model is organized as a three-level tree that has the following structure: object (e.g. a 'temperature sensor') object instance (e.g. 'temperature sensor #1', 'temperature sensor #2' etc.) resource (e.g. 'current temperature value') In terms of operations that can be performed on an LwM2M Client, an LwM2M Server can READ all of the data model entities, and, depending on their characteristics, may also WRITE to some of them, and execute some of them (COMMAND). Additionally, an LwM2M Server can also OBSERVE selected resources. Info If you would like to dive deeper into the details of the Lightweight M2M protocol, please refer to our brief introduction to LwM2M . This division into readable, writable, executable and observable data model entities is the basis for the mapping of LwM2M resources (as interpreted by Coiote DM) into the Azure IoT Central data processing mechanisms. LwM2M readable and writable resources # Within the Coiote DM - Azure IoT Central integration , readable and writable resources are interpreted as Properties. The data structure is represented in one line where objects, object instances, and resources are separated by n . For example: n1n0n3 , where 1 is object, 0 is object instance, and 3 is resource. In Azure IoT Central, Properties as well as other device capabilities (Telemetry and Command, read more on them below) are defined in a model which is part of the device template . The device template defines the characteristics of the device that is connected to your IoT Central application. READ - Communication flow # Data model resources that are read-only, such as Manufacturer (with ID 3/0/0 ) will be mapped to Azure IoT Central as a reported property. WRITE - Communication flow # On the other hand, a writable resource, such as Lifetime (with ID 1/0/1 ), apart from being represented as a reported property, can be additionally mapped as a desired property. This enables you to synchronize the device data model and configuration between Azure and Coiote DM. In Azure IoT Central, changing the value of a writable resource is done by running a job . LwM2M executable resources # As a rule, LwM2M resources that can be executable translate into Commands in Azure IoT Central. This means that by invoking Command from Azure, you can trigger a COMMAND operation on a chosen resource available for your device and the request will be transferred immediately by the LwM2M Server to the device. Note To learn about Commands, read the respective subsection in the Message payloads section. To do so, select a device from the Devices page in Azure IoT Central and click the Commands tab. Click Run to run a necessary command. COMMAND - Communication flow # Invoking Command from Azure IoT Central and handling it by Coiote DM in the form of a COMMAND operation passed to the device has the following flow: LwM2M observable resources # In Coiote DM, some of the resources within the device data model can be observed for changes in value. These are generally resources related to telemetry data or other measurements. Their value changes can be monitored by Coiote DM and reported to Azure IoT Central with help of Telemetry device capability. Note To learn more about Telemetry, go to the respective subsection of the Azure IoT Central documentation. Observe - Communication flow # Setting an Observe operation on a resource in Coiote DM, for instance a temperature reading, will result in a Notify message sent by the device upon value change. Then Coiote DM transfers this message to Azure IoT Central using Telemetry. To set an Observe operation in Azure IoT Central, you need to add a Job in the IoT Central application. As you can see in the Devices > Raw data tab, an Observation is represented in the following format: \u201cn1n1n1_attributes\u201d: \u201c(\\\u201dobserved\\\u201d:true,\\\u201dpmin\\\u201d:20}\u201d Next steps Configure integration templates","title":"LwM2M mappings - Azure IoT Central"},{"location":"Cloud_integrations/Azure_IoT/Concepts/LwM2M_mappings_Central/#lwm2m-mappings-azure-iot-central","text":"In this section you'll get to know how the mappings are arranged between the LwM2M protocol as used in Coiote DM and the data retrieval and processing mechanisms of Azure IoT Central.

While some are used for the communication between the Server and the LwM2M test device, others help to define the test logic. Read this chapter to learn how to use Actions in the configuration of customizable device tests. Action attributes # All the available Actions are defined using a set of configurable attributes that you can specify while adding or editing a test. The attributes available under each action are determined by the type of given Action. However, to set up a test, not all attributes are mandatory. The general rule is that if you leave an optional attribute\u2019s field blank, the final test result won\u2019t be affected in any way. Tip if you would like to make the test device ignore a particular attribute so that it doesn\u2019t answer to the server request, type None in the optional attribute\u2019s field. Description of Actions # Within the Server simulator tests, the following Actions are available. READ # READ is used to access the value of an object, object instances, a resource and single resource instances. You can define it using four attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter you want to read. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected value \u2013 if the value you enter here equals the value read from the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the value will only show up in the test log and it will have no impact on the test result. Note that this READ attribute works only for Resources and Resource Instances. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. LwM2M: Requested content format \u2013 the content format of the device answer that you request for your read operation. If the device doesn\u2019t support the requested format, the test will fail. If left blank, the device can decide what content format to use; any format will be accepted. WRITE # WRITE is used to change the value of a Resource. You can define it using four attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you want to set a new value or overwrite the existing one. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Value \u2013 the value you enter here sets a new value or overwrites the existing one. If left blank, the existing value will be kept and the test will be passed. LwM2M: Content format \u2013 the content format in which you send the write request to the device. If the device doesn\u2019t support the specified format, the test will fail. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. EXECUTE # EXECUTE is used to initiate some action and can only be performed on individual Resources. If the device receives an EXECUTE for an Object Instance(s) or Resource Instance(s), it will return an error. You can define it using two attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will issue an execute. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Execute arguments \u2013 the execution arguments passed to the device expressed in Plain Text format. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. DISCOVER # DISCOVER is used to discover LwM2M Attributes attached to an Object, Object Instances, and Resources. You can define it using two attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter whose attributes you want to discover. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. DELETE # DELETE is used for the server to delete an Object Instance within the LwM2M Client. Note that an Object Instance to be deleted must be an Object Instance that is announced by the Client to the Server using the Register and Update operations of the Client Registration Interface. Object instance \u2013 the object instance that you want to delete. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. CREATE # CREATE is used by the Server simulator to create Object Instance(s) within the LwM2M Client. You can define the action using three parameters and a set of Object Instance-dependent values: Object ID or name \u2013 the Object that you want to create an Instance for. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Portfolio\u2019) or the numerical (e.g. \u201816\u2019) value of the parameter. LwM2M: Instance number \u2013 the number assigned to the Object Instance to be created. If left blank, the number will be chosen by the device. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Resources \u2013 click the Provide initial values button to view and specify the possible Resources and Resource Instances of the Object Instance to be created. Note that if the values marked as required are left blank, the action will fail for devices that correctly implement LwM2M. WRITE ATTRIBUTES # WRITE ATTRIBUTES is used to attach metadata containing parameters for Notifications to an Object, an Object Instance or a Resource. You can define it using seven attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will write attributes. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Minimum period \u2013 the minimum time in seconds that the device waits between two notifications. Maximum period \u2013 the minimum time in seconds that the device waits between two notifications. Value greater than \u2013 notifications will be sent only when the monitored value crosses the threshold you set here. However, please note that the interpretation of this parameter may differ depending on the specific LwM2M Client implementation. Value less than \u2013 notifications will be sent only when the monitored value crosses the threshold you set here. However, please note that the interpretation of this parameter may differ depending on the specific LwM2M Client implementation. Step \u2013 the minimum change value between two notifications. CLEAR ATTRIBUTES # CLEAR ATTRIBUTES is used to clear the metadata attached to an Object, an Object Instance or a Resource which contain parameters for Notifications. You can define it using seven attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will clear attributes. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Clear minimum period \u2013 if set to true, it clears the minimum time in seconds between two notifications. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear maximum period \u2013 if set to true, it clears the maximum time set between two notifications. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear value greater than \u2013 if set to true, it clears the threshold set for the monitored value. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear value less than \u2013 if set to true, it clears the threshold set for the monitored value. If set to false, the value is kept. Clear step \u2013 if set to true, it clears the minimum change value between two notifications. If set to false, the value is kept. OBSERVE # OBSERVE is used to initiate an observation request for changes of a specific Resource, Resources within an Object Instance or for all the Object Instances of an Object. You can define it using four attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter whose value(s) you will observe. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Fail if already observed \u2013 if set to true, the test will fail in case there is an existing observation set on this parameter. In case there is no observation set, your observe request should be accepted and the test won\u2019t fail. If set to false, any existing observations will be cancelled and requested again by this one and the test will be passed. LwM2M: Content format \u2013 the content format in which you send the OBSERVE request to the device. If the device doesn\u2019t support the specified format, the test will fail. CANCEL OBSERVE # CANCEL OBSERVE is used to cancel an observation. You can define it using three attributes: Parameter name \u2013 the name of the data model parameter for which you will cancel an existing observation. Note that it can be specified either using the full name in the string (e.g. \u2018Device.0.Manufacturer) or the numerical (e.g. 3.0.1) value of the parameter. Cancel type \u2013 the mode in which the CANCEL OBSERVE will be sent to the device. o ACTIVE - CANCEL OBSERVE is sent to the device immediately. o PASSIVE - CoAP RESET is sent in response to the next notification message received from the device. Expected response code \u2013 if the response code you enter here equals the response code returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default response code defined by the LwM2M standard. Firmware Update # Firmware Update is used to perform a firmware update operation on the test device. You can define it using five attributes: Firmware \u2013 the ID of the resource used as the firmware source. Update timeout \u2013 the time period in seconds within which the firmware update should be completed. In case the timeout is up and the update process has not finished, the action will fail. Delivery method \u2013 The protocol and transfer method used to deliver the firmware file to the device. Use notifications \u2013 if set to true, an OBSERVE will be issued automatically for the \u2018State\u2019 and \u2018Update result\u2019 parameters while upgrading the device. The notifications returned by the device will be visible in the test logs. Expected update result \u2013 if the update result you enter here equals the result returned by the device, the test will be passed. If left blank, the server will expect the default result defined by the LwM2M standard. You can choose among the ten update results defined as per the LwM2M protocol specification. WAIT # Wait is used to set the waiting time before executing the next action. You can define it using two attributes: Waiting time \u2013 the interval set before the next action is executed. In progress message \u2013 a custom text that will be displayed as the test progress message while waiting for the execution of the next action. Pause response # Pause response is used to delay a response to be sent to the device. If set, the server will wait before sending the response until the Send paused response action is executed. Request type \u2013 the kind of request for which you want to pause the response. Wait for uplink request # Wait for uplink request is used to prevent the server from executing any tasks or actions until an uplink request arrives from the device. You can define the action using three attributes: Request type to wait for \u2013 the kind of request you want to wait for. Timeout \u2013 the time period in seconds within which the uplink request should arrive. In case the timeout is up with no request, the action will fail. Waiting message \u2013 the message displayed during the test execution while waiting for the arrival of the uplink request. Send paused response # Send paused response is used to send the previously paused response to the device. Request type \u2013 the kind of request for which you want to send the previously paused response. Start Notification recording # Start Notification recording is used to make the Server simulator save all notifications received from the device in its memory. The limit of recorded notifications can be configured using the ddscNotificationRecordingLimit setting value. Once the limit is reached, new notifications are not recorded. Execute the Start Notification recording action again in the same test to clear the recording state and to be able to match more notifications than the recording limit. Expect Notification # Expect Notification is used to check if recorded Notifications match the required criteria. You can define it using five attributes: Expected path \u2013 only notifications that were received on this path will be validated. In case of a notification with multiple paths and values, each path and value are treated as separate notifications. Expected value \u2013 use it to check if there is any notification that has a given value and matches all other criteria. Expected arrival order \u2013 use it to limit the validation only to one notification on a given path that arrived in a given order since the last Start Notification recording action. Note that the counting starts from 0 and that the Observe response is also counted if it is executed after the recording action started. Timeout \u2013 if the expected notification does not arrive within this time limit, the action will fail. Waiting message \u2013 a custom text that will be displayed as the test progress message while waiting for the action execution. Start Send recording # Start Send recording is used to make the Server simulator save all Send messages sent from device in its memory. The limit of recorded Send messages can be configured using the ddscSendRecordingLimit setting value. Once the limit is reached, new Send messages are not recorded. Execute the Start Send recording action again in the same test to clear the recording state and to be able to match more Send messages than the recording limit. Expect Send # Expect Send is used to check if recorded Send messages match the required criteria. You can define it using five attributes: Expected path \u2013 only Send messages that were received on this path will be validated. In case of a Send message with multiple paths and values, each path and value are treated as separate messages. Expected value \u2013 use it to check if there is any Send message that has a given value and matches all other criteria. Expected arrival order \u2013 use it to limit the validation only to one Send message on a given path that was sent in a given order since the last Start Send recording action. Timeout \u2013 if the expected Send message does not arrive within this time limit, the action fails. Waiting message \u2013 a custom text that is displayed as the test progress message while waiting for the action execution. Loop start # Loop start is used to repeat an action or a set of actions within a test. Note that when configuring the first action inside the loop, the Loop end action is added automatically. Repetitions \u2013 the number of iterations of action(s) inside the loop.","title":"Test actions"},{"location":"Coiote_IoT_DM/Device_tests/Test_actions/#test-actions","text":"","title":"Test actions"},{"location":"Coiote_IoT_DM/Device_tests/Test_actions/#introduction","text":"Based on the LwM2M 1.0 standard protocol operations, Actions are steps that can be defined within a test.

Also, keep in mind that running a pipeline in GitLab requires a docker image of a Linux distribution (or any operating system that can run python script). image : name : example.repository.com/docker-local/linux_image protocol-tests : stage : test script : - python3 example_filename.py artifacts : when : always paths : - report.xml reports : junit : report.xml Save the file as gitlab-ci.yml and upload it to the chosen branch of your project repository. Follow Step 2 from Creating a Jenkins multibranch pipeline (uploading a file with python script to your GitLab repository). Run a created pipeline for your project: Go to your GitLab project and in the Dashboard view, select CI/CD from the menu on the left and click Pipelines . Attention Note that to be able to run a pipeline, you will need to have the GitLab CI/CD toolset configured. For details, please check https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/introduction/index.html . You should be able to see the branch with the uploaded gitlab-ci.yml file. Select the Run pipeline button, then confirm again by clicking Run pipeline . Once the pipeline execution is finished, you should be able to see the results in the Tests tab of your pipeline.

Svetovid is based on a state-of-the-art Anjay LwM2M client developed by AVSystem. It features the FSDM (File System Data Model) in which LwM2M objects are mapped to folders that follow a particular schema, and executables behave as expected by the LwM2M client that loads and manages them. This tutorial will show you how to implement a temperature LwM2M object on your device and a push button using Svetovid. This will enable live readings of their resources (temperature, push button state and counter) in Coiote DM. Prerequisites # Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 with a configured operating system and a set-up WiFi connection. A Sense HAT or a GrovePi with a temperature sensor ( DHT11 or similar) and a push button ( Grove-button or similar). A user with access to the Coiote IoT Device Management platform and appropriate permissions. Step 1: Prepare your Sense HAT/GrovePi # Sense HAT # Install the Sense HAT packages: sudo apt-get install sense-hat Check if Sense HAT is working correctly: Create a hello_world.py file: from sense_hat import SenseHat sense = SenseHat() sense.show_message(\"Hello World!\") Run the program: python hello_world.py If a Hello World! message is displayed, you're good to proceed. Note If you're new to Sense HAT, follow the getting started tutorial . GrovePi # To install the GrovePi repository, paste and execute the following commands: mkdir ~/Dexter cd ~/Dexter git clone https://github.com/DexterInd/GrovePi cd ~/Dexter/GrovePi/Script bash ./update_grovepi.sh Check if the GrovePi libraries are working correctly: Connect a LED module to GrovePi port D4. In the terminal, type: cd ~/Dexter/GrovePi/Software/Python && python grove_led_blink.py The LED should start blinking. Step 2: Install Svetovid # To install Svetovid, paste and execute the following commands into your command-line terminal: mkdir ~/AVSystem cd ~/AVSystem git clone https://github.com/AVSystem/Svetovid-raspberry-client.git cd Svetovid-raspberry-client sudo dpkg -i svetovid_20.11-raspberry_armhf.deb sudo dpkg -i svetovid-plugin-fsdm_20.11-raspberry_armhf.deb sudo dpkg -i avsystem_svetovid-20.11-raspberry-Linux-fsdmtool-runtime-python.deb In file /usr/local/share/svetovid/bin/fsdm/lwm2m_object_registry.py , find the https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/test entry and replace it with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/prod . Step 3: Register your device in Coiote DM # Disable the Svetovid service: sudo systemctl disable svetovid.service --now Set the server connection details: in /etc/svetovid/config/security.json : { \"1\": { \"ssid\": \"1\", \"server_uri\": \"coaps://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud:5684\", \"is_bootstrap\": \"0\", \"security_mode\": \"psk\", \"pubkey_or_identity_hex\": \"XXXX\", \"privkey_or_psk_hex\": \"XXXX\", \"server_pubkey_hex\": \"\", \"holdoff_s\": \"0\", \"bs_timeout_s\": \"0\" } } in /etc/svetovid/config/svd.json : { \"device\": { \"endpoint_name\": \"YYYY\", \"udp_listen_port\": 1234 }, \"logging\": { \"default_log_level\": \"trace\", \"log_level\": { \"svd\": \"trace\" } }, \"lwm2m_version_config\": { \"min\": \"1.0\", \"max\": \"1.1\" }, \"in_buffer_size_b\": 1024, \"out_buffer_size_b\": 1024, \"msg_cache_size_b\": 65536 } Note XXXX and YYYY should be replaced by the chosen values of endpoint name, PSK identity and PSK key. Tip XXXX values are in hex. To convert your plain text, use the following: echo -n '<your-text-value>' | xxd -p Restart the Svetovid service: sudo systemctl start svetovid.service --now Step 4: Connecting to the LwM2M Server # To connect to Coiote IoT Device Management LwM2M Server, please register at https://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud .

Here\u2019s a tutorial to get you started with device provisioning using a dedicated script to be found in the Anjay Zephyr Client repository . Prerequisites # A Nordic board connected to your computer. Installed Go Programming language . Installed mcumgr command line tool . Zephyr development environment set up. An active Coiote DM cloud account. If you're using Windows: possibility to run Linux scripts/tools either via WSL, Cygwin or other. Important Please verify if the directory to which you installed Go is in your PATH variable. If it's missing please add it. Provision the device using PSK # This section shows how to provision your device using a pre-shared key (PSK). Prepare configuration: Before running the script some configuration should be set. Example configuration can be found in Anjay-zephyr-client/tools/provisioning-tool/configs directory. Edit endpoint_cfg contains LwM2M objects setting that will be uploaded to the device. Set RID.Security.PKOrIdentity and RID.Security.SecretKey . Make sure that RID.Security.Mode is set to 0 . Edit lwm2m_server.json modify domain entry to reflect your domain in Coiote server. This file is needed if you wish the script to automatically add the new device to Coiote DM. Get the Coiote DM Access Token The provisioning script can register your device to Coiote DM automatically. You might use this option for the sake of this tutorial, but this is an optional step. Note If you wish to skip device registration to Coiote DM, then call ptool.py without -t and -S options. First an access token needs to be generated. Create get_token.sh file: #!/bin/bash SERVER=\"https://eu.iot.avsystem.cloud\" echo \"Enter your login credentials for $SERVER\" read -p \"Login: \" USER read -p \"Password: \" -s PASS curl -X POST \\ -H \"Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" \\ --data-urlencode \"grant_type=password\" \\ --data-urlencode \"username=$USER\" \\ --data-urlencode \"password=$PASS\" \\ \"$SERVER/api/auth/oauth_password\" If you're using Linux, run chmod u+x get_token.sh to give execute rights. Under Windows you can use the GUI to allow execution of this file. Run ./get_token.sh . The script will ask you for your login and password for eu.iot.avsystem.cloud, please provide them. If a JSON structure containing \"access_token\" appears, you're ready to proceed. Copy your token. Important The token received is valid only for a short period of time. For more informaton how to aquire the access token see REST API authentication . Run provisioning tool Important After creating the correct configuration for provisioning make sure that west configuration is correct and the manifest.path is set to an absolute path.

You can check the serial number of your board by running: nrfjprog -i . The <TOKEN> should be the token acquired in previous step. Note To see all of the options available in the script run ./ptool.py -h . If everything went well then your device should be visible in Coiote DM.

Note In this step we will use endpoint_cfg_cert configuration file instead of endpoint_cfg . You may verify that the RID.Security.Mode is set to 2 in this configuration. Edit lwm2m_server.json modify domain entry to reflect your domain in Coiote server. Edit cert_info.json . This file contains information for generating a self signed certificate. This configuration is needed only if user don't want to provide certificates generated ealier. Get the certificate for eu.iot.avsystem.cloud . Run: openssl s_client -showcerts eu.iot.avsystem.cloud:5684 > /tmp/server.pem to download server certificate and then openssl x509 -outform der -in /tmp/server.pem -out /tmp/server.der to convert it to DER format.
