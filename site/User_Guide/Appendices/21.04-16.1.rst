New features

    * Light sessions do not run tasks, but Uplink requests are acknowledged,
    * values of Notifications and Sends are made available in the next non-empty session.

 * Adding group Value Tracking via configuration files was introduced.
 * Added possibility to perform CoAP ping connectivity check on device before task execution via the Coiote DM API.
