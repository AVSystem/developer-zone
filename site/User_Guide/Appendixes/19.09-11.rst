========

New features
------------

 * Added configurable option to enable/disable stripping plus character in SMS numbers.

Bug fixes
---------

 * The firmware update mechanism was fixed so that it ignores not supported firmware update protocols announced by device.
 * Unparseable device properties are now replaced with defaults, which is no longer causing devices to disappear from inventory.
 * REST API URLs are changed to contain 'coiotedm'.
 * Coiote can now handle unexpected change of target cluster node while handling GUI requests (HTTP[S]).
 * Coiote's connection to Redis can recover even after majority of Redis nodes go down.
 * Passing wrong DTLS identity while overriding device's LwM2M bootstrap server details with Coiote bootstrap server predefined details was fixed.
